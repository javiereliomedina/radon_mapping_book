# Radon Mapping 
R-scripts of the workshop: “Radon Mapping with R”.

In a one-day workshop I presented different options for interpreting indoor radon measurements. My main aim was to give a general overview of the potential use of R in radon mapping; from the exploratory data analysis to the generation of interactive maps which can be uploaded on the web. The scripts are based on my experiences on the topic, mainly in Ireland and with the EU indoor radon map. There are however much more things we can do with the data for having a better understanding of the radon issue. I will therefore update the repository from time to time, if you have suggestions or comments I will be more than happy to include them here.  

Please, fell free to use the R-scripts at your convenience. I would appreciate however your mention to my work.   

For more information about radon and radon mapping you may read:

Those are some of my last publications but you may find much more information (and probably even better explained) in this book, a little old but still valid and where you will have a comprehensive understanding of the radon issue:

If you were more interested in spatial data analysis, I would recommend you these books:

NOTE: The indoor radon measurements I use here have been simulated since these datasets are normally confidential (e.g. contain personalised data; i.e. addresses). Data are only useful therefore for training purpose, and any coincidence with a real case (i.e. Lithuania, geology) is casual.
