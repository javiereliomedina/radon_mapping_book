abstract = {Diffuse emissions of CO2 are known to be large around some volcanoes and hydrothermal areas. Accumulation-chamber measurements of CO2 flux are increasingly used to estimate the total magmatic or metamorphic CO2 released from such areas. To assess the performance of accumulation chamber systems at fluxes one to three orders of magnitude higher than normally encountered in soil respiration studies, a test system was constructed in the laboratory where known fluxes could be maintained through dry sand. Steady-state gas concentration profiles and fractionation effects observed in the 30-cm sand column nearly match those predicted by the Stefan-Maxwell equations, indicating that the test system was functioning successfully as a uniform porous medium. Eight groups of investigators tested their accumulation chamber equipment, all configured with continuous infrared gas analyzers (IRGA), in this system. Over a flux range of {\~{}} 200-12,000 g m-2 day-1, 90{\%} of their 203 flux measurements were 0-25{\%} lower than the imposed flux with a mean difference of - 12.5{\%}. Although this difference would seem to be within the range of acceptability for many geologic investigations, some potential sources for larger errors were discovered. A steady-state pressure gradient of -20 Pa/m was measured in the sand column at a flux of 11,200 g m-2 day-1. The derived permeability (50 darcies) was used in the dusty-gas model (DGM) of transport to quantify various diffusive and viscous flux components. These calculations were used to demonstrate that accumulation chambers, in addition to reducing the underlying diffusive gradient, severely disrupt the steady-state pressure gradient. The resultant diversion of the net gas flow is probably responsible for the systematically low flux measurements. It was also shown that the fractionating effects of a viscous CO2 efflux against a diffusive influx of air will have a major impact on some important geochemical indicators, such as N2/Ar, ??15N-N2, and 4He/22Ne.

abstract = {Principal components analysis (PCA) is a multivariate data analysis tool that can be used to recombine the variables of a large multivariate dataset in such a way that the first few variables of the reconstructed dataset account for the majority of the variance in the data. Application of PCA in marine geochemistry has become quite common in recent years. In this study, we illustrate the use of PCA through examples that arose while investigating the geochemistry of sinking particles during the MedFlux project. The examples presented do not simply repeat the analyses of the original study, but instead extend them in the context of simultaneous application of PCA and cluster analysis. Our results show that constructing a one dimensional (1D) " degradation index" using only the first principal component (PC) is in most cases oversimplified, and that constructing 2D or 3D " degradation trajectories" with the first 2 or 3 PCs is more informative. Use of the first three PCs is indicated when the variance explained by the third PC is comparable in magnitude to that explained by the second PC in the reconstructed dataset. We also discuss the use of scree plots and cluster analysis in helping decide whether the third PC is needed to capture the essential information in the dataset. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Drought is a recurrent natural hazard that is expected to increase in the future due to anthropogenic climate change. The Middle East region witnessed a drought period between 2007 and 2009 that has been reported to have severe consequences for the population, especially in Syria and Iraq. This study seeks to assess the spatial and temporal characteristics of the drought in the Duhok Governorate in northern Iraq, focusing on meteorological, agricultural and socioeconomic drought at province and village level. Satellite-based precipitation data, validated by station data, were used in a meteorological drought assessment. To estimate the decreased precipitation's effects on vegetation, an agricultural drought assessment was performed using Enhanced Vegetation Index from multi-temporal satellite data. Vegetation anomalies were studied at provincial level, and also at village level where the anomalies were compared with survey data showing the socioeconomic susceptibility to drought. The study confirms that precipitation dropped by approximately 50 {\%}, leading to a negative anomaly in vegetation conditions for 62 {\%} of Duhok Governorate's area in 2008. Out of 50 assessed villages, 46 experienced a negative vegetation anomaly during the drought year, and three of those experienced a strong negative anomaly. Reports of drought as a problem were frequently recorded in the exposed villages, but were also related to the level of agricultural involvement. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding drought from both physical and socioeconomic perspectives. Moreover, discrepancies in the datasets make a multi-source approach essential to avoid erroneous interpretations.},

abstract = {Aims: To describe the development of a deprivation index for Danish parishes and to investigate its association with all-cause mortality compared with the Townsend index and individual-level factors. Methods: Nine socioeconomic factors were aggregated to the parish level from individual-level register data comprising the entire Danish population in 2005. A principal component analysis was conducted to reduce the number of factors and to apply weights. An ecological analysis investigated the association between the Danish Deprivation Index (DANDEX) and standardised mortality ratios in Danish parishes. Results were compared with the Townsend index and a possible modifying effect of population density was investigated. Sensitivity of the index was investigated with multilevel survival analyses evaluating the association between all-cause mortality and DANDEX, the Townsend Index, individual-level socioeconomic factors, and population density. Results: DANDEX consists of two components measuring socioeconomic properties of all 2119 Danish parishes. The first component measures deprivation related to housing (house and car ownership) while the second component is related to classical measures of socioeconomic status (education, income, occupation). A clear gradient in standardised mortality ratios was seen across quintiles of both index components. Modifying effects were seen when stratifying the index components by population density. In a frailty model, DANDEX accounted for 76{\%} of the between-parish variation in all-cause mortality, while the Townsend index and individual socioeconomic factors accounted for 71 and 76{\%}, respectively.Conclusions: The index can be used to identify Danish parishes by their levels of deprivation and it provides municipalities with a tool to allocate resources to the geographic areas where they are most needed. {\textcopyright} 2013, the Nordic Societies of Public Health.

The empirical analysis carried out using multinomial logit modelling shows a strong negative association between the family life-cycle and migration. The findings indicate that migration takes place mainly due to the demands of the husband's career, resulting in the wives being tied migrants. Two-earner families are less migratory, and in that sense the husbands are tied stayers. Distance matters; several differences are noticed between short- and long-distance migrants.},

abstract = {This research was done to demonstrate the usefulness of the local structural geology characteristics to predict indoor radon concentrations. The presence of geologic faults near dwellings increases the vulnerability of the dwellings to elevated indoor radon by providing favorable pathways from the source uranium-rich bedrock units to the surface. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analyses of variance by ranks were used to determine the distance where faults have statistically significant influence on indoor radon concentrations. The great-circle distance between the 640 spatially referenced basement radon concentration measurements and the nearest fault was calculated using the Haversine formula and the spherical law of cosines. It was shown that dwellings located less than 150 m from a major fault had a higher radon potential. The 150 m threshold was determined using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on: (1) all the basement radon measurements dataset and; (2) the basement radon measurements located on uranium-rich bedrock units only. The results indicated that 22.8{\%} of the dwellings located less than 150 m from a fault exceeded the Canadian radon guideline of 200 Bq/m(3) when using all the basement radon measurements dataset. This percentage fell to 15.2{\%} for the dwellings located between 150 m and 700 m from a fault. When using only the basement radon measurements located on uranium-rich bedrock units, these percentages were 30.7{\%} (0-150 m) and 17.5{\%} (150 m-700 m). The assessment and management of risk can be improved where structural geology characteristics base maps are available by using this proxy indicator.},

@article{Dowdall2017,
abstract = {In 2002, a National Radon Survey (NRS) in Ireland established that the geographically weighted national average indoor radon concentration was 89 Bq m−3. Since then a number of developments have taken place which are likely to have impacted on the national average radon level. Key among these was the introduction of amending Building Regulations in 1998 requiring radon preventive measures in new buildings in High Radon Areas (HRAs). In 2014, the Irish Government adopted the National Radon Control Strategy (NRCS) for Ireland. A knowledge gap identified in the NRCS was to update the national average for Ireland given the developments since 2002. The updated national average would also be used as a baseline metric to assess the effectiveness of the NRCS over time. A new national survey protocol was required that would measure radon in a sample of homes representative of radon risk and geographical location. The design of the survey protocol took into account that it is not feasible to repeat the 11,319 measurements carried out for the 2002 NRS due to time and resource constraints. However, the existence of that comprehensive survey allowed for a new protocol to be developed, involving measurements carried out in unbiased randomly selected volunteer homes. This paper sets out the development and application of that survey protocol. The results of the 2015 survey showed that the current national average indoor radon concentration for homes in Ireland is 77 Bq m−3, a decrease from the 89 Bq m−3 reported in the 2002 NRS. Analysis of the results by build date demonstrate that the introduction of the amending Building Regulations in 1998 have led to a reduction in the average indoor radon level in Ireland.},

abstract = {The Earth's climate is dependent upon the radiative balance of the atmosphere, which in turn depends upon the input of solar radiation and the atmospheric abundances of radiatively active trace gases (ie, greenhouse gases), clouds and aerosols. Since the industrial revolution the atmospheric concentrations of several greenhouse gases, ie, carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), nitrous oxide (N 2O), and tropospheric ozone (O 3), have been increasing, primarily due to human activities. Several of these greenhouse gases have long atmospheric lifetimes, decades to centuries, which means that their atmospheric concentrations respond slowly to changes in emission rates. In addition, there is evidence that the concentrations of tropospheric aerosols have increased at least regionally. -Authors},

abstract = {Abundances of 238U, 234U, 232Th, 226Ra, 228Ra, 224Ra, and 222Rn were measured in groundwaters of the Ojo Alamo aquifer in northwest New Mexico. This is an arid area with annual precipitation of ???22 cm. The purpose was to investigate the transport of U-Th series nuclides and their daughter products in an old, slow-moving groundwater mass as a means of understanding water-rock interactions and to compare the results with a temperate zone aquifer. It was found that 232Th is approximately at saturation and supports the view of Tricca et al. (2001) that Th is precipitated irreversibly upon weathering, leaving surface coatings of 232Th and 230Th on aquifer grains. Uranium in the aquifer waters has very high [234U/238U] ??? 9 and low 238U concentrations. These levels can be explained by low weathering rates in the aquifer (w238U ??? 2 ?? 10-18 to 2 ?? 10-17s-1) using a continuous flow, water-rock interaction model. The Ra isotopes are roughly in secular equilibrium despite their very different mean lifetimes. The 222Rn and 228Ra isotopes in the aquifer correspond to ???10{\%} of the net production rate of the bulk rock. This is interpreted to reflect an earlier formed irreversible surface coating of Th that provides Ra and Rn to the aquifer waters. The surface waters that appear to be feeding the aquifer have low [234U/238U] and high 238U concentrations. The flow model shows that it is not possible to obtain the high [234U/238U] and low [238U] values in the aquifer from a source like the present vadose zone input. It follows that the old aquifer waters studied cannot be fed by the present vadose zone input unless they are greatly diluted with waters with very low U concentrations. If the present sampling of vadose zone sources is representative of the present input, then this requires that there was a major change in water input with much larger rainfall some several thousand years ago. This may represent a climatic change in the Southwest. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{BSI1999,
abstract = {This British Standard has been prepared under the direction of the Sector Board for Building and Civil Engineering. It supersedes BS 5931:1981, which is withdrawn. The original code of practice for civil engineers, Site investigations, was prepared by a committee convened in 1943 by the Institution of Civil Engineers on behalf of the Codes of Practice Committee for Civil Engineering, Public Works, Building and Construction Work, under the aegis of the former Ministry of Works, for publication in the Civil Engineering and Public Works Series. The code was published in 1950. In 1949, the responsibility for the preparation and issue of the codes of practice in the Civil Engineering and Public Works Series was handed over to the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Municipal Engineers, the Institution of Structural Engineers and the Institution of Water Engineers. Arrangements for the preparation and publication of these codes were made by the Civil Engineering Codes of Practice Joint Committee constituted by those four Institutions. In 1954, agreement was reached between the professional Institutions concerned, the British Standards Institution and the Council for Codes of Practice for Buildings (under the aegis of the former Ministry of Works) to transfer responsibility for the issue of codes of practice to the British Standards Institution. At the request of the British Standards Institution, a committee was convened by the Institution of Civil Engineers to amend the 1950 code. A revised code was published in 1957 by the British Standards Institution, under authority of its Council for Codes of Practice, as CP 200l. The Institution of Civil Engineers similarly convened a further committee in 1965 to prepare a revised code. In 1976, the convening responsibility was transferred to the British Standards Institution and a revised code was issued in 1981 as BS 5930. With one or two minor exceptions, this was a completely new text. Under the continuing authority of the British Standards Institution, this revision has been prepared with the following objectives: a) To clarify the scope of BS 5930: 1981: in this code, the term "soil" has the meaning ascribed to it by common current usage in UK civil engineering and construction. A number of current British Standards define "soil" in relation to its use in agriculture and horticulture. In order to avoid any possible confusion, the title of BS 5930 has been revised in order to indicate its precise application. b) To revise material in BS 5930: 1981, which is now obsolescent. To this effect, there is new information on geophysical surveying and a new annex on site investigations on contaminated ground, as well as smaller amendments throughout the code. c) To maintain compatibility with all the parts ofBS 1377:1990, Methods oftestfor soils for civil engineering purposes. The 1990 edition of BS 1377 covers a much greater number of tests than the 1975 edition of BS 1377, so whenever one of these tests is referred to in the revised BS 5930, only a very brief description is given and reference is made to BS 1377:1990 for more detailed information. d) To maintain conformity with European and International codes. In so far as information was available at the time of drafting, the revised BS 5930 is generally in agreement with comparable European and International codes. NOTE 1 The numbers in square brackets used throughout the text of this code relate to the references in the Bibliography. NOTE 2 This revision of BS 5930 was compiled prior to the major reorganization of the UK government departments subsequent to the UK General Election in May 1997. Throughout this text, the names of the various government departments are, in general, those appertaining prior to May 1997. The European Committee for Standardization, CEN, has the responsibility for preparing a series of Eurocodes, which would harmonize practice throughout the European Community and eventually would replace the existing national codes. The British Standards Institution (BS!) represents British interests in CEN. It is anticipated that a set of structural Eurocodes would relate to the structural and geotechnical design of civil engineering works. The proposed Eurocode 7, Geotechnical design and Eurocode 1, Basis of design, are likely to be relevant to BS 5930 and would give information that could be helpful in planning site investigations. A further proposed group of European Standards, The execution of special geotechnical works, would give specifications for standardizing practice throughout the European Community. Progress with the preparation of the Eurocodes is variable and as yet, none has reached final status. As a code of practice, this British Standard takes the form of guidance and recommendations. It should not be quoted as if it were a specification and particular care should be taken to ensure that claims of compliance are not misleading. A British Standard does not purport to include all the necessary provisions of a contract. Users of British Standards are responsible for their correct application. Compliance with a British Standard does not of itself confer immunity from legal obligations.},

abstract = {In the present investigation, analysis of radon concentration in 20 water and soil samples collected from different locations of Bikaner and Jhunjhunu districts of Rajasthan, India has been carried out by using RAD7 an electronic Radon detector. The measured radon concentration in water samples lies in the range from 0.50 to 22 Bq l−1 with the mean value of 4.42 Bq l−1, which lies within the safe limit from 4 to 40 Bq l−1 recommended by United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR, 2008). The total annual effective dose estimated due to radon concentration in water ranges from 1.37 to 60.06 $\mu$SV y−1 with the mean value of 12.08 $\mu$SV y−1, which is lower than the safe limit 0.1 mSv y−1 as set by World Health Organization (WHO, 2004) and European Council (EU, 1998). Radon measurement in soil samples varies from 941 to 10,050 Bq m−3 with the mean value of 4561 Bq m−3, which lies within the range reported by other investigators. It was observed that the soil and water of Bikaner and Jhunjhunu districts are suitable for drinking and construction purpose without posing any health hazard.},

abstract = {Geological sequestration of anthropogenic CO2 appears to be a promising method for reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released to the atmosphere. Geochemical modelling of the storage capacity for CO2 in saline aquifers, sandstones and/or carbonates should be based on natural analogues both in situ and in the laboratory. The main focus of this paper has been to study natural gas emissions representing extremely attractive surrogates for the study and prediction of the possible consequences of leakage from geological sequestration sites of anthropogenic CO2 (i.e., the return to surface, potentially causing localised environmental problems). These include a comparison among three different Italian case histories: (i) the Solfatara crater (Phlegraean Fields caldera, southern Italy) is an ancient Roman spa. The area is characterised by intense and diffuse hydrothermal activity, testified by hot acidic mud pools, thermal springs and a large fumarolic field. Soil gas flux measurements show that the entire area discharges between 1200 and 1500 tons of CO2 per day; (ii) the Panarea Island (Aeolian Islands, southern Italy) where a huge submarine volcanic-hydrothermal gas burst occurred in November, 2002. The submarine gas emissions chemically modified seawater causing a strong modification of the marine ecosystem. All of the collected gases are CO2-dominant (maximum value: 98.43 vol.{\%}); (iii) the Tor Caldara area (Central Italy), located in a peripheral sector of the quiescent Alban Hills volcano, along the faults of the Ardea Basin transfer structure. The area is characterised by huge CO2 degassing both from water and soil. Although the above mentioned areas do not represent a storage scenario, these sites do provide many opportunities to study near-surface processes and to test monitoring methodologies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Solidification experiments at (a) five different cooling rates (25, 12.5, 3, 0.5 and 0.125??C/min) between 1300 and 800??C, and (b) variable quenching temperatures (1100, 1000, 900 and 800??C) at a fixed cooling rate of 0.5??C/min were performed on an andesitic melt (SiO2=58.52wt.{\%} and Na2O+K2O=4.43wt.{\%}) at air conditions from high superheating temperature. The results show that simultaneous and duplicated experiments with Pt-wire or Pt-capsule produce identical run-products. Preferential nucleation on Pt-containers or bubbles is lacking. Plagioclase and Fe-Ti oxide crystals nucleate firstly from the melt. Clinopyroxene crystals form only at lower cooling rates (0.5 and 0.125??C/min) and quenching temperatures (900 and 800??C). At higher cooling rates (25, 12.5 and 3??C/min) and quenching temperature (1100??C), plagioclase and Fe-Ti oxide crystals are embedded in a glassy matrix; by contrast, at lower cooling rates (0.5 and 0.125??C/min) and below 1100??C they form an intergrowth texture. The crystallization of plagioclase and Fe-Ti oxide starts homogeneously and then proceeds by heterogeneous nucleation. The crystal size distribution (CSD) analysis of plagioclase shows that crystal coarsening increases with decreasing cooling rate and quenching temperature. At the same time, the average growth rate of plagioclases decreases from 2.1??10-6cm/s (25??C/min) to 5.7??10-8cm/s (0.125??C/min) and crystals tend to be more equant in habit. Plagioclases and Fe-Ti oxides depart from their equilibrium compositions with increasing cooling rate; plagioclases shift from labradorite-andesine to anorthite-bytownite. Therefore, kinetic effects due to cooling significantly change the plagioclase composition with remarkable petrological implications for the solidification of andesitic lavas and dikes. The glass-forming ability (GFA) of the andesitic melt has been also quantified in a critical cooling rate (Rc) of {\~{}}37??C/min. This value is higher than those measured for latitic (Rc {\~{}}1??C/min) and trachytic (Rc{\textless}0.125??C/min) liquids demonstrating that little changes of melt composition are able to significantly shift the initial nucleation behavior of magmas and the following solidification paths. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Soil geochemistry from areas of till can therefore be used to establish sediment provenance which in turn provides information on palaeo ice flow directions and ice sheet history.

abstract = {The eastern master fault of the Siena Graben (central Italy), known as Rapolano Fault, is a place of migration of a large amount of CO2-rich gas from deep geothermal reservoirs. Under particular topographical and meteoclimatic conditions, large emissions of carbon dioxide can represent serious hazards to human and animal life. Carbon dioxide is a carrier gas for radon (Rn), the concentrations of which are high in the soil despite the low U content of the overburden. CO2 pressure also drives the upwelling of thermal waters producing at the surface, in some places, radioactive (Ra-226 rich) travertine formations, inducing higher soil-gas Rn levels. Three main types of hazards, mechanical, toxicological and radio-ecological, may occur depending on the upwelling fluid phases (gas alone or gas plus water). Gas distribution and partitioning in different micro-environments (e.g., soil pores, groundwater, ground-atmosphere interface) should be taken into account when planning hazard-assessment surveys.},

abstract = {Neoclassical economics and the new economics of labour migration posit very different motivations for international migration. The former assumes that people move abroad permanently to maximize lifetime earnings whereas the latter assumes they leave temporarily to overcome market deficiencies at home. As a result, the two models yield very different conceptualizations of return migration. We draw upon each theoretical model to derive predictions about how different variables are likely to influence the probability of return migration. We use data from the German Socio-economic Panel to test specific hypotheses derived from each model. Finding some support for both perspectives, we suggest that migrants may be heterogeneous with respect to their migratory motivations. If so, then parameters associated with the determinants of return migration in any population of international migration will reflect a blending of parameters associated with two distinct economic rationales. Equations estimated separately for remitting and non-remitting migrants lend support to this interpretation, meaning there may not be one unitary process of return migration, but several.},

abstract = {Human activities are affecting the Earth's global carbon cycle. Transitioning away from fossil fuel use and finding viable alternatives will be difficult, costly, and long. We are now faced with a scientific and societal challenge of daunting proportions - determining if and how humans can manage the global cycle of one of the Earth's key elements. One strategy being investigated to mitigate growing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is to enhance the ocean's natural capacity to absorb and store atmospheric CO2, either by inducing and enhancing the growth of carbon-fixing plants in the surface ocean, or by speeding up the natural, surface-to-deep water transfer of dissolved CO2 by directly injecting it into the deep ocean. Determining the feasibility, efficiency, and environmental consequences of this process involves significant scientific, technological, economic, and legal investigation. But perhaps more importantly, this will require informing the public about these investigations, providing continuous, clear and unbiased information about the benefits, limitations, and possible consequences of actions and inactions. Public opinion may prove to be the deciding factor in any question of redirecting CO2 in the environment, and the public must be engaged as critical partners in this decision-making process. This Watching Brief has been developed for the Member States of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO as well as the general public. Since the first version of the Brief developed in 2001, significant progress has been made by the international scientific community to address these issues and implications.

abstract = {We demonstrate a strong correlation between domestic radon levels and socio-economic status (SES) in Great Britain, so that radon levels in homes of people with lower SES are, on average, only about two thirds of those of the more affluent. This trend is apparent using small area measures of SES and also using individual social classes. The reasons for these differences are not known with certainty, but may be connected with greater underpressure in warmer and better-sealed dwellings. There is also a variation of indoor radon levels with the design of the house (detached, terraced, etc.). In part this is probably an effect of SES, but it appears to have other causes as well. Data from other countries are also reviewed, and broadly similar effects seen in the United States for SES, and in other European countries for detached vs other types of housing. Because of correlations with smoking, this tendency for the lower SES groups to experience lower radon levels may underlie the negative association between radon levels and lung cancer rates in a well-known ecological study based on US Counties. Those conducting epidemiological studies of radon should be alert for this effect and control adequately for SES.},

This gloss is often inaccurate, but in the central highlands of the (former) Yemen Arab Republic, this family type represents both the cultural ideal and the social norm. Drawing on data from ten rural communities, this paper examines the convergence of family form and household composition. Recognizing that internal dynamics are probably central to household unity or division, five activities identified by Wilk and Netting (co-residence, production, transmission of property, reproduction, and distribution of resources) are discussed.},

In order to asses a relationship between LC deaths and radon accumulation in dwellings, indoor radon concentrations were measured with passive detectors randomly distributed in Chihuahua City. Kriging (K) and Inverse-Distance Weighting (IDW) spatial interpolations were carried out. Deaths were georeferenced and Moran's I correlation coefficients were calculated. The mean values (over n = 171) of the interpolation of radon concentrations of deceased's dwellings were 247.8 and 217.1 Bq/m(3), for K and IDW, respectively. Through the Moran's I values obtained, correspondingly equal to 0.56 and 0.61, it was evident that LC mortality was directly associated with locations with high levels of radon, considering a stable population for more than 25 years, suggesting spatial clustering of LC deaths due to indoor radon concentrations.},

In order to bring the technology towards reduced costs and to make CCS an economically viable mitigation option, the European Commission created a comprehensive demonstration programme aimed to encourage development and accelerate commercial CCS deployment. The goal was to have up to 12 CCS demonstration projects by 2015.This is far away from reality today. Despite the tremendous effort, the two major European CCS funds - the European Energy Programme for Recovery and more recently the New Entrants Reserve of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme Programme (NER300) - are struggling to secure a single demonstration project to move forward.Originally intended as a CCS instrument, the NER300 first round published on November 2010 has been followed with great expectation by CCS community. However, in December 2012 the Commission announced that not one CCS project was awarded.This paper reviews the NER300 process, analyses the reasons for the programme's lack of success in securing CCS demonstration projects, and distills the lessons learnt. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {To quantify the possible sources of the high ambient ozone concentration in the low troposphere over Taiwan, ozone sounding data from a two-year intensive field measurement program conducted in April and early May of 2004 and 2005 in northern Taiwan has been examined. We found that the vertical ozone distributions and occurrence of enhanced ozone in the lower troposphere (below 6??km) mainly resulted from (1)Type NE: the long-range transport of ozone controlled by the prevailing northeasterly winds below 2??km, (2)Type LO: the local photochemical ozone production process, and (3)Type SW: the strong southwest/westerly winds aloft (2-6??km). In the boundary layer (BL), where Asian continental outflow prevails, the average profile for type NE is characterized by a peak ozone concentration of nearly 65??ppb at about 1500??m altitude. For type LO, high ozone concentration with an average ozone concentration greater than 80??ppb was also found in the BL in the case of stagnant atmospheric and sunny weather conditions dominated. For type SW, significant ozone enhancement with average ozone concentration of 70-85??ppb was found at around 4??km altitude. It is about 10??ppb greater than that of the types NE and LO at the same troposphere layer owing to the contribution of the biomass burning over Indochina. Due to Taiwan's unique geographic location, the complex interaction of these ozone features in the BL and aloft, especially features associated with northeasterly and south/southwesterly winds, have resulted in complex characteristics of ozone distributions in the lower troposphere over northern Taiwan. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

We investigated three datasets representing different depositional environments (proximal terrestrial, distal terrestrial and deep-sea core), in order to determine source conditions such as plume height, erupted mass and grain-size and recreate the tephra fall deposit from the Plinian, co-ignimbrite and combined eruptive phases. The results of the DSM and OAT method agreed adequately well with each other for erupted mass, plume height and grain-size distribution. Both approaches were able to successfully recreate the Plinian deposit but estimating conditions that created the co-ignimbrite and deep-sea core dataset were less successful. The reduced agreement is the result of the low quantity (6 to 28 deposit points) and quality (inconsistent deposit depths at localities adjacent to each other) of the datasets, and the different dynamics between co-ignimbrite and Plinian columns, with the former not well represented in the model. Different sampling methods between archaeological and volcanological disciplines and post-depositional processes which have acted on the tephra deposits since the Bronze Age can explain the discrepancy between these computed and observed deposits. The seasonality of the Minoan eruption was investigated by using seasonal wind profiles for winter, spring, summer and autumn. We find that the Bronze Age eruption of Santorini is likely to have during the spring and summer months with a main dispersal axis aligned East. Crete would have received very little ash fall, and the eruption would not have caused much disruption to the life of the inhabitants of the island.},

The flow greatly damaged the Kaliurang and Turgo areas. Following this event, it was feared that another pyroclastic flow might cause additional damage to these areas because the lava dome continued to grow increasingly unstable. There was also fear that other pyroclastic flows would affect other areas on the flanks of Merapi Volcano. Using a 2-dimensional numerical simulation, the authors estimated the areas potentially affected by further pyroclastic flow activity. Numerical simulation has proved useful in determining potential areas of inundation on the south flank of Merapi Volcano. Although the simulations are sensitive to many input parameters, we have determined that the strongest influence comes from initial flow direction and topography.},

Two major unrest episodes characterized its recent history, each leading to remarkable ground uplift and followed by slow subsidence. Fumaroles near the caldera centre underwent important chemical changes during these volcanic crises. Based on published data we show that a correlation exits between ground displacement and gas composition. Numerical modelling of hydrothermal circulation shows that periods of enhanced fluid injection at the base of the hydrothermal system, are consistent with the observed chemical variations. The model predicts an average increase in pore pressure and temperature within the system, suggesting potential effects on ground deformation. Literature data and simulation results show that periods of intense magmatic degassing could explain most of the features characterizing recent bradyseismic crises and should be considered a potential trigger for the unrest at Phlegrean Fields, as well as at other calderas in the world.},

abstract = {We used a network of stations to perform systematic radon surveys at Stromboli volcano. The time series of periodic measurements show that monthly average222Rn emissions reflect changes in volcanic activity and exhibit increasing trends prior and during the last major eruptive cycles. Maps of radon emissions indicate that diffuse degassing is operative at Stromboli volcano. Concentrated degassing essentially occurs in the summit area and within a sector proximal to the two major NE trending faults. These sites were chosen for deploying the two real-time stations that are currently operating at Stromboli. In these devices, the222Rn electronic dosimeters are connected to a radiomodem for wireless data transfer to a receiving station at the volcano observatory. Radon activity, soil temperature and atmospheric pressure data are sampled and instantaneously transferred via web so that they can be checked remotely. Collected time series reveal an overall inverse correlation between radon emissions and seasonal temperature variations. Radon emissions in sectors of diffuse degassing are modulated by tidal forces as well. Radon activities recorded at the summit station, located along the fracture zone where the gas flux is concentrated, are positively correlated with changes in atmospheric pressure and confirm the occurrence of the "atmospheric stack effect". We finally emphasize that real-time radon monitoring is an innovative technique that may be systematically applied in volcano surveillance. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Deltas are among the most densely populated areas in the world and often suffer from water quality problems due to intensive agricultural land use. Transport of nutrients, metals and pesticides by shallow groundwater adds significantly to surface water quality problems. Therefore, regional groundwater transport modelling is increasingly used, but these transport models often require fine grid resolution to adequately simulate groundwater-surface water interaction. The fine grid resolution, however, limits opportunities for a thorough uncertainty analysis because of excessive computation times. Stream tube modelling is an alternative which allows for uncertainty analysis because computation times are limited even with fine grids. We present a stream tube modelling approach which combines 3D flow path distributed modelling with ID hydrogeochemical modelling and we compare the results with 3D transport modelling.. Model uncertainty was assessed by evaluating the grid resolution, and different weak sink options in particle tracking. The results indicate that using fine resolution models and a new weak sink option in MODPATH yield appropriate results. For example, the breakthrough of sulphate in the case study stream agrees well with an existing MT3D-model. The main advantage of the method, compared with regular 3D transport models, is the fast computation time which enables a spatial uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo or random field approaches.},

abstract = {Spatial distribution of concentrations of radon gas in the soil is important for defining high risk areas because geogenic radon is the major potential source of indoor radon concentrations regardless of the construction features of buildings. An area of southern Italy (Catanzaro-Lamezia plain) was surveyed to study the relationship between radon gas concentrations in the soil, geology and structural patterns. Moreover, the uncertainty associated with the mapping of geogenic radon in soil gas was assessed. Multi-Gaussian kriging was used to map the geogenic soil gas radon concentration, while conditional sequential Gaussian simulation was used to yield a series of stochastic images representing equally probable spatial distributions of soil radon across the study area. The stochastic images generated by the sequential Gaussian simulation were used to assess the uncertainty associated with the mapping of geogenic radon in the soil and they were combined to calculate the probability of exceeding a specified critical threshold that might cause concern for human health. The study showed that emanation of radon gas radon was also dependent on geological structure and lithology. The results have provided insight into the influence of basement geochemistry on the spatial distribution of radon levels at the soil/atmosphere interface and suggested that knowledge of the geology of the area may be helpful in understanding the distribution pattern of radon near the earth's surface.},

We analyzed the relation between biomarkers and exposures with mixed-effects models adjusted for potential confounders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Indoor and outdoor PAHs (low-, medium-, and high-molecular-weight PAHs), followed by hopanes (vehicle emissions tracer), were positively associated with biomarkers, but other organic components and transition metals were not. sTNF-RII increased by 135 pg/mL [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 45-225 pg/mL], and IL-6 increased by 0.27 pg/mL (95{\%} CI, 0.10-0.44 pg/mL) per interquartile range increase of 0.56 ng/m3 outdoor total PAHs. Two-pollutant models of PM0.25 with PAHs showed that nominal associations of IL-6 and sTNF-RII with PM0.25 mass were completely confounded by PAHs. Vehicular emission sources estimated from chemical mass balance models were strongly correlated with PAHs (R = 0.71).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Traffic emission sources of organic chemicals represented by PAHs are associated with increased systemic inflammation and explain associations with quasi-ultrafine particle mass.},

abstract = {In the analysis of data it is often assumed that observations y,, y,,...,y, are independently normally distributed with constant variance and with expectations specified by a model linear in a set of parameters 0. In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples. 1.},

abstract = {Soil gas baseline and assurance monitoring was performed over the CO2CRC Otway Project demonstration site for six years (2007-2012). The main objective of the monitoring was assurance monitoring, to demonstrate to regulators that there were no adverse environmental impacts on soils. The use of the method for leakage detection was also of research interest. Soil gas sampling was carried out annually over a defined grid, in preparation for and during the experimental storage of 65,000tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the Waarre C Formation at a depth of about 2km. CO2, methane, oxygen and nitrogen were the main gases analysed. Advanced analytics included helium and $\delta$CCO213 measurements. Baseline monitoring allowed us to develop an understanding of the local variability in soil gas CO2 concentrations in anticipation of the CO2 injection. Interpretation of the concentrations of CO2 in terms of possible leakage rates (fluxes) is not possible without more detailed models and measurements of the possible transport mechanisms of CO2 to and through the vadose zone. However, the comparison of post-injection with baseline data, the examination of fixed gas relationships and C/13CCO212 isotopes showed that most CO2 in the soil was of biogenic origin. A deep subsurface source, which would indicate deep gas migration to the surface, was not apparent.This shows that there is little impact of the injected CO2 on the local ecosystem and, in conjunction with other monitoring data, helps to satisfy our regulatory requirements. Our work is a case study of a practical soil gas monitoring programme and illustrates both the utility and the limitations of the technique. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Brittle tectonics and ground degassing, including fracture-field, soil-gas and exhalation flux analyses of CO2 and CH4, were studied at Ustica Island, a Pleistocene volcanic complex in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea. The mesoscopic fracture pattern perfectly fits an E-W-trending left-lateral strike-slip master fault, in agreement with the main morpho-structural submarine alignment including Ustica Island and Anchise Seamount. Along the SW-NE high-angle normal Arso Fault, geological evidence of reactivation with different kinematics (left- to right-lateral displacements) was recognised. Major CO2 and CH4 degassing (with fluxes up to 93,750 and 20 t km-2 a-1, respectively, and soil-gas concentrations of 11.3{\%} and 5.7 ppm) occur over the Arso Fault. Although this fault is mapped just in the SW sector of the island, soil-gas CO2 anomalies point out its clear continuation up to the NE margin of the island. These data, together with those of previous geophysical and geochemical results from off-shore Ustica, suggest that the Arso Fault is the local evidence of a more important active, gas-bearing structure. This tectonic feature is interpreted as a reactivation of a preexistent SW-NE trend, inherited as a second-order structure of the E-W deep shear zone. The reactivation is related to the interplay among different structures of the Southern Tyrrhenian basin.},

However, many of these measures suffer from one or more issues such as poor resistance to outliers and scale dependence. In this paper, while summarising commonly used accuracy measures, a special review is made on the symmetric mean absolute percentage error. Moreover, a new accuracy measure called the Unscaled Mean Bounded Relative Absolute Error (UMBRAE), which combines the best features of various alternative measures, is proposed to address the common issues of existing measures. A comparative evaluation on the proposed and related measures has been made with both synthetic and real-world data. The results indicate that the proposed measure, with user selectable benchmark, performs as well as or better than other measures on selected criteria. Though it has been commonly accepted that there is no single best accuracy measure, we suggest that UMBRAE could be a good choice to evaluate forecasting methods, especially for cases where measures based on geometric mean of relative errors, such as the geometric mean relative absolute error, are preferred.},

abstract = {Radon is one of the most comprehensively studied human carcinogens. It is a naturally occurring noble gas, and due to current construction methods, radon concentrations often become enhanced indoors. Radon is the largest single contributor to the natural radiation exposure to the general public. Two of its radioactive decay products, polonium-218 and polonium-214, impart the majority of radiation dose to the lungs, rather than the radon gas itself. In fact, protracted exposure to radon and its decay products is one of the greatest environmental health threats. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in North America and the leading cause of lung cancer for individuals who have never smoked. Overall, radon is also the leading environmental cause of cancer mortality in North America. In vitro studies, controlled studies of radon-exposed animals, a variety of radiobiological analyses, 15 retrospective cohort studies of radon-exposed underground miners, and analyses of 22 pooled residential epidemiologic studies from North America, China, and Europe convincingly demonstrate that radon is a human lung carcinogen even at concentrations commonly encountered in the residential setting. Because of the significant health risks related to residential radon exposure, the World Health Organization (WHO) instituted an international initiative in 2005, the International Radon Project, to reduce indoor radon risks. This article and the following articles on radon provide a general overview of its characteristics, sources, occurrence, and health effects, as well as guidance on both radon measurement and mitigation.},

The parallel framework can accommodate high-volume remotesensed radar (or satellite) observations as well as conventional observations that usually have larger covariance localization radii. The performance of the parallel algorithm has been tested with simulated and real radar data. The parallel program shows good scalability in pure MPI and hybrid MPI/OpenMP modes, while pure OpenMP runs exhibit limited scalability on a symmetric shared-memory system. It is found that in MPI mode, better parallel performance is achieved with domain decomposition configurations in which the leading dimension of the state variable arrays is larger, because this configuration allows for more efficient memory access.

abstract = {Space-time modeling of small area data is often used in epidemiology for mapping chronic disease rates and by government statistical agencies for producing local estimates of, for example, unemployment or crime rates. Although there is typically a general temporal trend, which affects all areas similarly, abrupt changes may occur in a particular area, e.g. due to emergence of localized predictors/risk factor(s) or impact of a new policy. Detection of areas with "unusual" temporal patterns is therefore important as a screening tool for further investigations. In this paper, we propose BaySTDetect, a novel detection method for short-time series of small area data using Bayesian model choice between two competing space-time models. The first model is a multiplicative decomposition of the area effect and the temporal effect, assuming one common temporal pattern across the whole study region. The second model estimates the time trends independently for each area. For each area, the posterior probability of belonging to the common trend model is calculated, which is then used to classify the local time trend as unusual or not. Crucial to any detection method, we provide a Bayesian estimate of the false discovery rate (FDR). A comprehensive simulation study has demonstrated the consistent good performance of BaySTDetect in detecting various realistic departure patterns in addition to estimating well the FDR. The proposed method is applied retrospectively to mortality data on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in England and Wales between 1990 and 1997 (a) to test a hypothesis that a government policy increased the diagnosis of COPD and (b) to perform surveillance. While results showed no evidence supporting the hypothesis regarding the policy, an identified unusual district (Tower Hamlets in inner London) was later recognized to have higher than national rates of hospital readmission and mortality due to COPD by the National Health Service, which initiated various local enhanced services to tackle the problem. Our method would have led to an early detection of this local health issue.},

abstract = {Spatial continuous data (spatial continuous surfaces) play a significant role in planning, risk assessment and decision making in environmental management. They are, however, usually not readily available and often difficult and expensive to acquire, especially for mountainous and deep marine regions. As geographic information systems (GIS) and modelling techniques are becoming powerful tools in natural resource management and biological conservation, spatial continuous data of environmental variables are increasingly required. Environmental managers often require spatial continuous data over a region of interest to make effective and informed decisions and scientists need accurate data which are well-distributed across a region to make justified interpretations. However, spatial distribution data of natural phenomena are often collected from point sources. The marine environment in Australia is a typical case, where: seabed mapping, habitat classification, and prediction of marine biodiversity, essential for marine biodiversity conservation, need reliable spatial continuous data of the marine environment. In most of the Australian marine region, such data are not available, and only sparsely and unevenly scattered point samples have been collected. Therefore, spatial interpolation techniques are essential for estimating biophysical variables for the unsampled locations. The spatial interpolation methods, including geostatistics, have been developed for and applied to various disciplines. They are data-specific or even variable-specific. Many factors including sample size, sampling design and data properties affect the estimations of the methods. There are no consistent findings about how these factors affect the performance of the spatial interpolators. Therefore, it is difficult to select an appropriate spatial interpolation method for a given input dataset. This review aims to provide some guidelines and suggestions in relation to the application of the spatial interpolation methods to environmental data by comparing the features of the commonly applied spatial interpolators. Over 40 spatial interpolation methods are briefly described. They fall into three categories, namely: non-geostatistical interpolators (12), geostatistical interpolators (22) and combined methods (8). Many sub-methods or types are also included, for example, 8 stratified methods and 6 types of regression kriging. A list of the methods that are not commonly used is also provided for those readers interested. iv The spatial interpolation methods were developed either for specific disciplines or even for specific variables based on the data properties modelled. Each method has its specific assumptions and features. These features, such as global versus local, exact versus inexact, deterministic versus stochastic, and gradual versus abrupt, are discussed. In total, 26 spatial interpolation methods are compared theoretically and their features are summarised. Commonly used assessment measures are summarised in relation to: 1) the performance of variogram models, 2) the performance of the spatial interpolation methods, and 3) the performance of a spatial interpolation method for datasets with different sample sizes. The criteria used to judge each measurement are also discussed. Two new measurements are proposed and a procedure is developed to compare the results of the performance of the spatial interpolation methods for different variables and from various disciplines. The spatial interpolation methods have been applied to many disciplines. The focus of this review is mainly on comparative studies in environmental sciences. For each of the 51 comparative studies considered, the following information, including the methods compared, sampling design, sample size, area of region studied and the results, is summarised. The performance of 62 methods and sub-methods in the 51 comparative studies is compared. Four types of method groups are identified based on the frequency of their application. Several factors that affect the performance of the spatial interpolation methods are discussed, including sampling design, sample spatial distribution, data quality, correlation between the primary and secondary variables, and interaction among various factors. The impacts of sample density, variation in the data, sampling design and stratification on the estimations of the spatial interpolation methods are quantified using data from 77 cases in 17 reviewed comparative studies. The results show that variation within the data is a dominant factor and has tremendous impacts on the performance of the spatial interpolators. As the variation increases, the accuracy of all methods decreases. Irregular-spaced sampling design and stratification would improve the accuracy of estimation. There is no evidence of the effects of sampling density on the performance of the spatial interpolation methods in this comprehensive comparative study. v A total of 26 commonly used spatial interpolation methods are then classified based on their features to provide an overview of relationships among these methods. These features are quantified and a cluster analysis is conducted to show similarities among these spatial interpolators. They are classified into 10 groups. To provide guidelines for potential users, a decision tree for selecting an appropriate method from the 26 spatial interpolation methods is developed according to the availability and nature of data. Finally, a list of available software packages for spatial interpolation is provided. Some important factors for spatial interpolation in marine environmental science are discussed, and recommendations are made for applying spatial interpolation methods to marine environmental data in Geoscience Australia},

abstract = {This study analyzes the changes of NO2 vertical tropospheric columns (VTCs) over Europe during the period 2004-2009 using a statistical model, based on a homogeneous high-quality data set of observations of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument OMI. At each point of a regular grid, a Generalized Additive regression Model (GAM) with non-parametric model terms was fitted to the observed columns to describe the most relevant factors contributing to the observed variability in NO2 VTCs. These factors include annual cycle, day of week, wind, precipitation, retrieved cloud radiance fraction, and trend. Significant negative changes are found in areas with large anthropogenic sources over Western Europe (mostly from??-4 to??-8{\%} year-1). The overall negative changes are consistent with EMEP/CEIP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme/Center on Emission Inventories and Projections) emission estimations and previous trend studies. However, we found remarkably large spatial variations in NO2 column changes within individual regions. Our analysis shows that in particular the NOx emissions from Spanish power plants (from??-10 to approx.??-20{\%} year-1) and over the center of England (up to approx.??-12{\%} year-1) have been strongly reduced in the past few years, at a rate exceeding the reported emission changes averaged over the individual country. A number of other features of the temporal behavior of the time series of tropospheric NO2 distributions over Europe were quantified, including clear annual and weekly cycles. Modeling the influence of wind considering both wind direction and wind speed not only improves the accuracy of the trend results, but can be particularly interesting for identifying the sources of the NO2 VTCs and the transport pathways of air pollutants. The effects of precipitation are observed to vary obviously during warm and cold months, due to the strong seasonal dependence of soil NOx emissions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The southern area of Italy is characterized by the presence of many active volcanic areas. In Pozzuoli (Naples, Italy), an urban area characterized by high volcanic risk, a gas emitting site is present. A high percentage of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is emitted, whose atmospheric concentration measurement is an important task in many environmental and scientific applications. In this paper, we describe the utilization over that area of a mobile infrared (IR) laser system, able to measure the CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} concentration along rectilinear atmospheric paths up to 1-km length, and the result of tomographic processing applied to retrieve a two-dimensional CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} concentration field. The laser system computes the link averaged concentration by processing the received IR laser radiation propagated along an open-air rectilinear link connecting the transmitter/receiver laser unit and a passive retroreflector device. A one-day measurement campaign has been made and 15 different atmospheric propagation links were considered moving the transmitter/receiver unit and some retroreflectors.},

abstract = {In the Tyrrhenian region of central Italy, late Quaternary fossil travertines are widespread along two major regional structures: the Tiber Valley and the Ancona–Anzio line. The origin and transport of spring waters from which travertines precipitate are elucidated by chemical and isotopic studies of the travertines and associated thermal springs and gas vents. There are consistent differences in the geochemical and isotopic signatures of thermal spring waters, gas vents and present and fossil travertines between east and west of the Tiber Valley. West of the Tiber Valley, $\delta$13C of CO2 discharged from gas vents and $\delta$13C of fossil travertines are higher than those to the east. To the west the travertines have higher strontium contents, and gases emitted from vents have higher 3He/4He ratios and lower N2 contents, than to the east. Fossil travertines to the west have characteristics typical of thermogene (thermal spring) origin, whereas those to the east have meteogene (low-temperature) characteristics (including abundant plant casts and organic impurities). The regional geochemical differences in travertines and fluid compositions across the Tiber Valley are interpreted with a model of regional fluid flow. The regional Mesozoic limestone aquifer is recharged in the main axis of the Apennine chain, and the groundwater flows westward and is discharged at springs. The travertine-precipitating waters east of the Tiber Valley have shallower flow paths than those to the west. Because of the comparatively short fluid flow paths and low (normal) heat flow, the groundwaters to the east of the Tiber Valley are cold and have CO2 isotopic signatures, indicating a significant biogenic contribution acquired from soils in the recharge area and limited deeply derived CO2. In contrast, spring waters west of the Tiber Valley have been conductively heated during transit in these high heat-flow areas and have incorporated a comparatively large quantity of CO2 derived from decarbonation of limestone. The elevated strontium content of the thermal spring water west of the Tiber Valley is attributed to deep circulation and dissolution of a Triassic evaporite unit that is stratigraphically beneath the Mesozoic limestone. U-series age dates of fossil travertines indicate three main periods of travertine formation (ka): 220–240, 120–140 and 60–70. Based on the regional flow model correlating travertine deposition at thermal springs and precipitation in the recharge area, we suggest that pluvial activity was enhanced during these periods. Our study suggests that travertines preserve a valuable record of paleofluid composition and paleoprecipitation and are thus useful for reconstructing paleohydrology and paleoclimate.},

abstract = {The concentration of gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) in surface seawater is a fundamental control on the CO2 flux between the ocean and atmosphere. However, the concentration gradient in the aqueous mass boundary layer determines the magnitude and direction of the flux. The gradients of CO2 in the aqueous mass boundary layer cannot be measured directly and are usually inferred from partial pressures or fugacities of CO2 (fCO2) in the air and water. In addition to the fCO2, the temperatures at the top and bottom of the aqueous mass boundary layer must be known to determine the thermodynamic driving force of CO2 gas transfer. Expressing the gradient in terms of the aqueous CO2 concentration, [CO2aq], also avoids some conceptual ambiguities. In particular, expressing the CO2 as a fugacity, which is defined relative to the gas phase, when the gas exchange rate is controlled in the aqueous mass boundary layer often leads to errors in interpretation with respect to changes in boundary layer temperature. As a result the enhanced CO 2 flux caused by the cool skin effect appears to be overestimated. Apart from the difficulties estimating the temperature at the top and bottom of the aqueous mass boundary layer, the temperature dependence of solubility and fugacity of CO2 is uncertain to the degree that it can bias air-sea CO2 flux estimates. The CO2aq at the surface, [CO 2aq0], is at equilibrium with the atmospheric CO2 level. As [CO2aq0] is strongly temperature dependent, it will be significantly higher at high latitude compared to low latitude, while atmospheric CO2 levels show much less of a gradient. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

It has been developed and is being maintained by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, in line with its mission, based on the Euratom Treaty: to collect, validate and report information on radioactivity levels in the environment of the EU Member States.This work describes the first version of the European Atlas of Natural Radiation, available in digital format through a web portal, as well as the methodology and results for the maps already developed. So far the digital Atlas contains: an annual cosmic-ray dose map; a map of indoor radon concentration; maps of uranium, thorium and potassium concentration in soil and in bedrock; a terrestrial gamma dose rate map; and a map of soil permeability.Through these maps, the public will be able to: familiarize itself with natural environmental radioactivity; be informed about the levels of natural radioactivity caused by different sources; have a more balanced view of the annual dose received by the European population, to which natural radioactivity is the largest contributor; and make direct comparisons between doses from natural sources of ionizing radiation and those from man-made (artificial) ones, hence, to better assess the latter.Work will continue on the European Geogenic Radon Map and on estimating the annual dose that the public may receive from natural radioactivity, by combining all the information from the different maps. More maps could be added to the Atlas, such us radon in outdoor air and in water and concentration of radionuclides in water, even if these sources usually contribute less to the total exposure.},

abstract = {Assemblage of main fracture and subordinate fractures form a fracture zone. Geometry, orientation, and permeability of fracture zone are significant factors for exploration and assessment of geothermal resources. Because these fracture attributes, which have an effect on the hydrothermal system represented by flow pattern and physical condition of hot fluids, are difficult to be clarified on a field scale, a combination of several methods is required for the fracture-zone characterization. This paper presents a case study of this characterization on the Aso caldera in southwestern Japan. The study consists of the three parts, lineament analysis, numerical simulation, and geophysical survey. Lineaments are derived from SPOT panchromatic imagery and used to calculate azimuths and dips of the major fractures associated with the origin of hot springs. A numerical simulation using finite element method is aimed at estimating the configuration and permeability of the fracture zone, formed by a gathering of the major fractures. By this calculation, the fracture zone was inferred to consist of two prisms that incline at angles of 70?-80? in the opposite direction of the mountain slope, and have permeability, 102 greater than that of the country, volcanic rocks. Moreover, the radon survey using scintillation counter method and soil gas near the fumaroles has been conducted to investigate the temporal changes of radon concentrations at the three sites, located on the two prisms. A difference in the temporal change patterns among the sites may result from the physical conditions of the hydrothermal fluids ascending through the prisms.},

The free areal exhalation rate was measured by the sealed cup-technique, whereas the radium content was obtained by the alpha-autoradiographic method. The calibration coefficient for thoron measurements in air using cylindrical cup equipped with LR-115 detector was estimated. Moreover, the calibration coefficients for measurements of the specific activities of 224Ra and 226Ra were also evaluated. New method was developed for evaluating the emanation coefficient as well as the diffusion coefficient of radon isotopes in the studied materials. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The CF is based on effective trapping of CO2, the proposed concept that takes into account both the probability and impact of CO2 leakage. The CF uses probability estimates of the intersection of conductive faults and wells with the CO2 plume along with modeled fluxes or concentrations of CO2 as proxies for impacts to compartments (such as potable groundwater) to calculate CO2 leakage risk. In order to test and refine the approach, we applied the CF to (1) a hypothetical large-scale GCS project in the Texas Gulf Coast, and (2) WESTCARB's Phase III GCS pilot in the southern San Joaquin Valley, California. ?? 2009 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).},

abstract = {Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) grown for biomass feedstock production has the potential to increase soil C sequestration, and soil CO2 flux in grassland is an important component in the global C budget. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the effects of N fertilization and harvest frequency on soil CO2 flux, soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), and potentially mineralizable carbon (PMC); and (2) evaluate the relationship of soil CO2 flux with soil temperature, soil moisture, SMBC, and PMC. Two N rates (0 and 224 kg ha-1) were applied as NH4NO3 and cattle (Bos Taurus L.) manure. Switchgrass was harvested every year at anthesis or alternate years at anthesis. The data were collected during growing season (May-October) 2001-2004 on switchgrass-dominated Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land in east-central South Dakota, USA. Manure application increased soil CO2 flux, SMBC, and PMC during the early portion of the growing season compared with the control, but NH4NO3 application did not affect soil CO2 flux, SMBC, and PMC. However, seasonal variability of soil CO2 flux was not related to SMBC and PMC. Estimated average soil CO2 fluxes during the growing periods were 472, 488, and 706 g CO2-C m-2 for control, NH4NO3-N, and manure-N plots, respectively. Switchgrass land with manure application emitted more CO2, and approximately 45{\%} of the C added with manure was respired to the atmosphere. Switchgrass harvested at anthesis decreased soil CO2 flux during the latter part of the growing season, and flux was lower under every year harvest treatment than under alternate years harvest. Soil temperature was the most significant single variable to explain the variability in soil CO2 flux. Soil water content was not a limiting factor in controlling seasonal CO2 flux. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Portable x-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry represents a powerful technique for the chemometric study of the materials as opposed to the more usual destructive x-ray-based methods. A large set of limestones belonging to several formations cropping out in the Hyblean area (southeastern Sicily, Italy) was analyzed by means of a PXRF instrument. The main goal was to test the portential of PXRF to discriminate rocks with similar features and to create a chemical database of carbonate rocks that were commonly used in the past in the manufacturing of sculptures and stone artifacts. Fluorescence data were processed by means of multivariate statistical analysis. In particular, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis were applied. The results made it possible to classify the samples belonging to different formations and to distinguish different rock typologies within each formation. Finally, the investigation showed that the analytical PXRF data can be suitable for a substantial characterization of stone materials, and this could be extended to museum materials belonging to cultural heritage.},

abstract = {This paper studies the temporal variation of soil gas radon activity concentration in a highly permeable (k=2.0E-11m2) sandy-gravelly soil in order to understand if temporal variation of soil gas radon activity concentration can affect geogenic radon potential determination. Geogenic radon potential provides information about the potential risk from radon. Its calculation takes into account the equilibrium, saturated at infinite depth, soil gas radon activity concentration (c∞). This concentration may vary at annual time scale due to the environmental conditions. A long-term (yearly) and high temporal resolution (15min) observation, applied in this study, reveal various temporal features such as long-term trend, seasonality, daily periodicity and sudden events in soil gas radon time series.Results show seasonal and daily periodical variation of the measured soil gas radon activity concentration (csoilRn) in a highly permeable sandy-gravelly soil with definite seasons without obvious long transitional periods. The winter (from October 2010 to April 2011) is characterized by 2.5 times higher average soil gas radon activity concentration (median is 7.0kBqm-3) than the summer (August, September 2010 and May, June, July 2011) (median is 2.8kBqm-3). Daily periodicity, which is much less than the seasonal one, controls the soil gas radon activity concentration mainly in the summer season. Average (AM) value of csoilRnis higher at night than in the daytime with about 18{\%} and 3.8{\%} in summer and in winter, respectively. As a conclusion, in case of single csoilRnmeasurement on a highly permeable (k≥2.0E-11m2) soil, similar to our test site, csoilRnshould be corrected according to the seasons for calculating the equilibrium activity concentration c∞value. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Exposure to radon gas is the second most common cause of lung cancer after smoking. A large number of studies have reported that exposure to indoor radon, even at low concentrations, is associated with lung cancer in the general population. This paper reviewed studies from several countries to assess the attributable risk (AR) of lung cancer death due to indoor radon exposure and the effect of radon mitigation thereon. Worldwide, 3-20 {\%} of all lung cancer deaths are likely caused by indoor radon exposure. These values tend to be higher in countries reporting high radon concentrations, which can depend on the estimation method. The estimated number of lung cancer deaths due to radon exposure in several countries varied from 150 to 40,477 annually. In general, the percent ARs were higher among never-smokers than among ever-smokers, whereas much more lung cancer deaths attributable to radon occurred among ever-smokers because of the higher rate of lung cancers among smokers. Regardless of smoking status, the proportion of lung cancer deaths induced by radon was slightly higher among females than males. However, after stratifying populations according to smoking status, the percent ARs were similar between genders. If all homes with radon above 100 Bq/m(3) were effectively remediated, studies in Germany and Canada found that 302 and 1704 lung cancer deaths could be prevented each year, respectively. These estimates, however, are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty related to the weakness of the models used and a number of factors influencing indoor radon concentrations.},

abstract = {Radon (222Rn) gas is produced in the radioactive decay chain of uranium (238U) which is an element that is naturally present in soils. Radon is transported mainly by diffusion and convection mechanisms through the soil depending mainly on the physical and meteorological parameters of the soil and can enter and accumulate in buildings. Health risks originating from indoor radon concentration can be attributed to natural factors and is characterized by geogenic radon potential (GRP). Identification of areas with high health risks require spatial modeling, that is, mapping of radon risk. In addition to geology and meteorology, physical soil properties play a significant role in the determination of GRP. In order to compile a reliable GRP map for a model area in Central-Hungary, spatial auxiliary information representing GRP forming environmental factors were taken into account to support the spatial inference of the locally measured GRP values. Since the number of measured sites was limited, efficient spatial prediction methodologies were searched for to construct a reliable map for a larger area. Regression kriging (RK) was applied for the interpolation using spatially exhaustive auxiliary data on soil, geology, topography, land use and climate. RK divides the spatial inference into two parts. Firstly, the deterministic component of the target variable is determined by a regression model. The residuals of the multiple linear regression analysis represent the spatially varying but dependent stochastic component, which are interpolated by kriging. The final map is the sum of the two component predictions. Overall accuracy of the map was tested by Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation. Furthermore the spatial reliability of the resultant map is also estimated by the calculation of the 90{\%} prediction interval of the local prediction values. The applicability of the applied method as well as that of the map is discussed briefly.},

abstract = {Predictions of global climate change have recently focused attention on soils as major sources and sinks for atmospheric CO2, and various methodologies exist for measuring soil surface CO2 flux. A static (passive CO2 absorption in an alkali trap over 24 h) and a dynamic (portable infra-red CO2 gas analyzer over 1-2 min) chamber method were compared. Both methods were used for 100 different site x treatment x time combinations in temperate arable, forest and pasture ecosystems. Soil surface CO2 flux estimates covered a wide range from 0 to ca. 300 mg CO2 C m-2 h-1 by the static method and from 0 to ca. 2500 mg CO2 C m-2 h-1 by the dynamic method. The relationship between results from the two methods was highly non-linear, and was best explained by an exponential equation. When compared to the dynamic method, the static method gave on average 12{\%} higher flux rates below 100 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1, but much lower flux rates above 100 mg CO2 C m-2 h-1. Spatial variability was large for both methods, necessitating a large number of replicates for reliable field data, with typical coefficients of variation being in the range 10-60{\%}, usually higher with the dynamic than the state method. Diurnal variability in soil surface CO2 flux was partly correlated with soil temperature, whereas day-to-day variability was more unpredictable. However, use of a mechanistic simulation model of CO2 transport in soil SOILCO2, showed that very large day-to-day changes in soil surface CO2 flux can result from rainfall events causing relatively small changes in soil water content above field capacity (ca. -10 kPa), even if CO2 production rates remained relatively unaffected.},

abstract = {The paper presents the results of year-long measurements of radon (222Rn) concentration inside 129 buildings in Poland in relation to the geological conditions of their foundation. The authors took into account the division of the country into tectonic units, as well as the lithology of the rocks forming the bedrock of these buildings. As expected, the highest value of mean annual 222Rn concentration (845Bq/m3) was recorded in a building situated in the area of the Sudetes, while the highest geometric mean (characteristic of the expected log-normal data distribution) was calculated based on measurements from buildings located within the East-European craton, in the area of Mazury-Podlasie monocline, where it reached 231Bq/m3. Such results reflect geological conditions - the occurrence of crystalline rocks (especially U- and Ra-enriched granites and orthogneisses) on the surface in the Sudetes, and of young post-glacial sediments containing fragments of Scandinavian crystalline rocks, also enriched with U and Ra, in the area of Mazury-Podlasie monocline. However, the least expected result of the investigations was finding out that, contrary to the hitherto widespread belief, none of the major tectonic units of Poland can be excluded from the list of those containing buildings with mean annual 222Rn concentration exceeding 200Bq/m3. The mean annual concentration of radon for all the buildings were much higher than the mean concentration value (49.1Bq/m3) of indoor radon in Poland quoted so far. These results cast a completely new light on the necessity to perform measurements of radon concentration in residential buildings in Poland, no more with reference to small areas with outcrops of crystalline rocks (especially the Sudetes, being the Polish fragment of the European Variscan belt), but for all the major tectonic units within Poland. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This set of data was analyzed to investigate the seasonal variability of soil-gas radon concentration in an area which has various geological conditions but similar climate. The results show several different patterns of seasonal variations, but all of which can be largely attributed to the water-saturation and moisture-retention characteristics of the shallow part of the soil. During the rainy winter and spring seasons, radon tended to be confined underground by the water-saturated surface soil which had much reduced gas permeability, while during the sunny summer and autumn seasons, it exhaled more readily as the soil became drier and more permeable. At several sites located on creeping faults, the radon-variation patterns changed with time, possibly because of disturbance of site condition by fault movement. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

This work presents results from radon measurements (indoor, soil and exhalation from building materials) in B{\^{a}}iţa-ştei, a former uranium exploitation area in NW Romania. In this region, indoor radon concentrations found were as high as 5000 Bq m-3and soil radon levels ranged from 20 to 500 kBq m-3. An important contribution from building materials to indoor radon was also observed. Our results indicate two independent sources of indoor radon in the surveyed houses of this region. One source is coming from the soil and regular building materials, and the second source being uranium waste and local radium reached material used in building construction. The soil as source of indoor radon shows high radon potential in 80{\%} of the investigated area. Some local building materials reveal high radon exhalation rate (up to 80 mBq kg-1h-1from a sandy-gravel material, ten times higher than normal material). These measurements were used for the radon risk classification of this area by combining the radon potential of the soil with the additional component from building materials.

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and geological storage (CCS) is a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The determination of carbon dioxide storage capacity and the selection and characterisation of potential sites for CO2 storage are key issues in taking CCS forward. Most current storage capacity estimates are imperfect and there is a need for more understanding of the issues and more general agreement on assessment methodologies for site selection. This report provides an overview of the key issues and challenges in storage capacity estimation and storage site selection and suggests methodologies to address the issues and to meet those challenges. A distinction is made between available pore volume (a theoretical estimate of the amount of pore space that can be used to store CO2 in subsurface geologic formations) and storage capacity (the pore volume constrained by economic or engineering feasibility limitations). The term total pore volume is introduced to define the entire volume which is estimated to exist originally in sedimentary basins, naturally occurring storage systems or potential storage sites, plus the estimated pore volume yet to be identified. Total pore volume is subdivided into discovered and undiscovered pore volume. Storage capacity is considered a resource, and as in petroleum accumulations and mineral deposits, categorised based on levels of certainty of resource availability. Three categories are proposed: operational storage capacity is discovered pore volume that is considered commercially viable i.e. CO2 is injectable under existing technical, economic and regulatory conditions. Operational storage capacity, which is further classified as proved (1P), proved plus probable (2P) and proved plus probable plus possible (3P) categories following standard petroleum industry nomenclature. Contingent storage capacity is discovered pore volume which will be commercial in the future when technical, economic and regulatory conditions are in place and prospective storage capacity is undiscovered pore volume which might become commercial at some future time. Because of uncertainties inherent in subsurface evaluation, exact quantification of geological properties is not possible and therefore storage capacity is always, at best, an approximation of the amount of pore space into which CO2 can be injected. Hence, the likelihood of contingent and prospective storage volumes achieving commerciality is determined probabilistically, utilising high, low and best estimates. The selection of storage sites suitable for significant volumes of CO2 comprises mainly geological evaluation of the applicable storage system (e.g. saline formations, depleted or near depleted oil and gas reservoirs and/or coal systems) on various levels of detail. These correspond to degrees of confidence in estimating storage capacity. Country or state screening involves identification of appropriate sedimentary basins which can then be screened and ranked as to their overall suitability for CO2 storage. Evaluation of the size and thickness of the basin gives an indication of total pore volume it may hold. More detailed basin assessment allows the estimation of the prospective storage capacity in each of the identified storage systems and trap types. Site characterisation is the most time-consuming and costly part of the CO2 storage site selection process! Site characterisation typically involves collection and analysis of more detailed information than basin assessment investigations and may involve re-evaluation of regional geology and generation of new data and/or updating of existing data such as static (geologic and seismic) and dynamic (flow simulation and injection) data. The level of detail used in site characterisation allows the estimation of contingent pore capacity. The ultimate goal of a storage project is commercial site deployment, which requires all the geological, engineering, economic and regulatory considerations of a site being taken into account. Site deployment therefore requires estimation of operational storage capacity. The various scales of site selection and the different levels of storage capacity estimation need to be integrated and the processes for these analyses need to be iterative. The natural variability and geological, engineering and economic complexity of any potential CO2 storage site means that each site needs to be assessed individually; however, a similar workflow can be applied to all site evaluations. This report attempts to provide a consistent and systematic set of methodologies that can be used in assessing and classifying CO2 storage volumes of potential storage sites in Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere.},

We find that, rather than a scientific depiction of a migratory phenomenon, its cartography peddles a crude distortion of undocumented migration that smoothly splices into the xenophobic tradition of propaganda cartography–and stands in full confrontation with contemporary geographical scholarship. We conclude with an urgent appeal for more scientifically robust, critical and decidedly more creative cartographies of migration.},

abstract = {Underground accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) is a widespread geological phenomenon, with natural trapping of CO2 in underground reservoirs. Information and experience gained from the injection and/or storage of CO2 from a large number of existing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and acid gas projects, as well as from the Sleipner, Weyburn and In Salah projects, indicate that it is feasible to store CO2 in geological formations as a CO2 mitigation option. Industrial analogues, including underground natural gas storage projects around the world and acid gas injection projects, provide additional indications that CO2 can be safely injected and stored at well-characterized and properly managed sites. While there are differences between natural accumulations and engineered storage, injecting CO2 into deep geological formations at carefully selected sites can store it underground for long periods of time: it is considered likely that 99{\%} or more of the injected CO2 will be retained for 1000 years. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs, possibly coal formations and particularly saline formations (deep underground porous reservoir rocks saturated with brackish water or brine), can be used for storage of CO2 . At depths below about 800–1000 m, supercritical CO2 has a liquid-like density that provides the potential for efficient utilization of underground storage space in the pores of sedimentary rocks. Carbon dioxide can remain trapped underground by virtue of a number of mechanisms, such as: trapping below an impermeable, confining layer (caprock); retention as an immobile phase trapped in the pore spaces of the storage formation; dissolution in the in situ formation fluids; and/or adsorption onto organic matter in coal and shale. Additionally, it may be trapped by reacting with the minerals in the storage formation and caprock to produce carbonate minerals. Models are available to predict what happens when CO2 is injected underground. Also, by avoiding deteriorated wells or open fractures or faults, injected CO2 will be retained for very long periods of time. Moreover, CO2 becomes less mobile over time as a result of multiple trapping mechanisms, further lowering the prospect of leakage.},

abstract = {The first radon soil gas survey in Serbia, using passive detectors (SSNTD, CR-39), was carried out in June 2005 at field sites in Ni{\v{s}}ka Banja town. The aim of the survey was to identify risk zones characterised by high levels of this radioactive gas. Radon measurements were made at the depth of 50 cm, in the ground according to a systematic grid pattern. Furthermore, at all 48 measurement points, the surface gamma dose rates in the air was also measured at the same locations and soil samples were collected for gamma spectrometric analysis for the radionuclides 226Ra, 228Th and 40K. Radon concentrations were found to range from 1270 to 155 000 Bq m- 3 with an average of 33 765 Bq m- 3 and a median value of 12 626 Bq m- 3. The geometrical mean value and geometrical standard deviation were calculated as 16 160 Bq m- 3 and 3.5 Bq m- 3, respectively. Gamma dose rate varies from 92 to 316 nGy h- 1, with an average of 132 nGy h- 1. The radium content in collected soil samples ranges from 24 to 1810 Bq kg- 1 with an average of 187 Bq kg- 1. High correlations (r2 {\textgreater} 0.8) between soil gas radon concentration, gamma dose rate and 226Ra content in soil were found for each pair.

CCS has advanced towards commercialisation, notably through the commissioning of CCS pilot plants, continued learning from plants already in operation and the development of legal and regulatory frameworks. Several governments have committed to provide over USD 26 billion in funding support for demonstration projects. International collaborative and public outreach activities have increased substantially. The mapping of suitable storage sites is underway in various countries and a guide for CCS‐ready plant has been developed. Critical to the deployment of CCS, however, is the experience to be gained from the operation of large‐scale demonstration projects. While much progress has been achieved, the recommendation made by the G8 Leaders at the 2008 Hokkaido Toyako Summit that 20 large‐ scale CCS demonstration projects should be launched by 2010 remains a challenge and will require that governments and industry work in concert. To measure progress against the goal of launching 20 large‐scale CCS projects by 2010, the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF) and the Global CCS Institute reviewed government initiatives and developed a set of assessment criteria against which to review progress by industry. Over the past two years, governments have made significant commitments that will facilitate the launch of between 19 and 43 large‐scale CCS integrated demonstration projects by 2020. This is very promising, as government support is vital to helping projects under development overcome the final hurdles. A study commissioned by the Global CCS Institute (2010) identified 80 large‐scale integrated projects at various stages of development around the world. Notable efforts from both government and industry can be found in the United States, the European Union, particularly the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Five large‐scale CCS projects1 are in operation, all commissioned prior to the 2008 G8 Summit. From the pool of 80 projects, one new project, the Australian Gorgon project, has been launched and is proceeding to construction. A strong momentum has been developed over the past two years. It is important that governments and industry intensify future collaboration to accelerate the pace of development for the full implementation of the G8 goals.},

abstract = {Statistical tools to analyze correlated binary data are spread out in the existing literature. This book makes these tools accessible to practitioners in a single volume. Chapters cover recently developed statistical tools and statistical packages that are tailored to analyzing correlated binary data. The authors showcase both traditional and new methods for application to health-related research. Data and computer programs will be publicly available in order for readers to replicate model development, but learning a new statistical language is not necessary with this book. The inclusion of code for R, SAS, and SPSS allows for easy implementation by readers. For readers interested in learning more about the languages, though, there are short tutorials in the appendix. Accompanying data sets are available for download through the book s website. Data analysis presented in each chapter will provide step-by-step instructions so these new methods can be readily applied to projects. Researchers and graduate students in Statistics, Epidemiology, and Public Health will find this book particularly useful.

abstract = {Whether house prices rise faster or slower than average incomes affects the level of home ownership and the riskiness of different means of financing house purchase. This study develops a model of the housing market with the property that the major determinant of house price rises relative to incomes is the evolution of population density. The model implies that if population density is on an upward trajectory, rises in population and in incomes increasingly generate price responses and diminishing rises in the stock of housing. Rises in population density make high and rising levels of house prices likely; this makes alternatives to standard debt financing of home ownership become more desirable. The impact this has on the structure of risk-sharing contracts between providers of outside equity and homeowners is analysed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Scottish Economic Society.},

@article{Parkinson2008,
abstract = {Emissions of greenhouse gases are expected to cause climate change. The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2) and the major source of it is the combustion of fossil fuels to supply energy. Emissions can be reduced by a variety of measures, such as improving energy efficiency and developing alternative energy sources, like wind and solar power. However, a rapid move away from fossil fuels is unlikely as energy supply infrastructure has a long lifetime, and such a move could destabilise economies. Another way to reduce emissions is to capture the CO2 that is released from fossil fuel-fired power plants and store it underground. This is the focus of this report, as power generation accounts for about one-third of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use. The current leading technologies for power generation are pulverised fuel (PF) combustion steam cycles and natural gas combined cycles (NGCC). The IEA Greenhouse Gas R{\&}D Programme (IEA GHG) has assessed the performance and costs of these power plants, both with and without the capture of CO2. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) for the gasification of coal, which was included in the assessment, may be a suitable technology from which to capture CO2. A number of criteria were specified for all the studies to enable the results to be compared in a meaningful manner. The main specifications are listed in the Annex at the end of the report. CO2 can be captured by a variety of methods which are classified as post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxy-combustion. Post-combustion capture uses a solvent to capture CO2 from the flue gas of power plants. In pre-combustion capture the fuel is reacted with air or oxygen and then with steam to produce a mixture of CO2 and H2. The CO2 is removed and the hydrogen is used as the fuel. Oxy-combustion is when oxygen is used for combustion instead of air, which results in a flue gas that consists mainly of CO2 and is potentially suitable for storage. The next chapter describes the capture processes in more detail. The effect on the power plants of capturing the CO2 is explained later in this report, in terms of the reduction in efficiency, the emissions of CO2 and the extra consumption of resources by the plant. The choice of power plant and CO2 capture method is put in context by considering some of the other factors involved, such as the choice of fuel, as well as sensitivity to the cost of fuel and the load factor. The conclusions are drawn in the final chapter.},

abstract = {National legislation, which implements European Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM in Ireland, sets a reference level of 400 Bq m(-3) averaged over any 3 month period for radon exposure in the workplace and also empowers the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to direct employers to have radon measurements carried out. This legislation came into effect in May 2000. Radon measurements have already been completed in show caves and other underground workplaces. Between 1998 and 2001, over 33 800 individual radon measurements were carried out in all ground floor offices and classrooms in 3444 schools nationwide as part of a programme undertaken jointly with the Department of Education and Science. Where the average indoor radon concentration in one or more rooms exceeded 200 Bq m(-3), remedial measures were implemented. For concentrations up to 400 Bq m(-3) this involved increased ventilation while for higher concentrations an active sump was normally installed. The results of the survey, as well as the effectiveness of the different remedial strategies, are discussed. In the case of other above ground workplaces, different approaches have been adopted. As a first step, workplaces in two known high radon areas were directed to have radon measurements carried out. This programme had limited success because of problems in obtaining accurate workplace databases and a general lack of awareness on the part of employers of the issues involved. From a sample of 2610 employers directed to measure radon, only 408 actually completed measurements and 37 workplaces were identified as having average 3 month average radon concentrations above 400 Bq m(-3). A total of 1356 employers ignored all correspondence, some of which was sent by registered post and signed for on receipt. Current initiatives are focused on the provision of information and include newspaper advertising as well as publications aimed specifically at both employer and employee representative groups. The ability to provide accurate information that encourages both measurement and remediation is seen as central to an effective radon workplace programme.},

Yet I argue that the ‘transit country' is a contested space, a space where ‘temporariness' may be produced purposefully in order to limit opportunities for protection. In this paper, I argue that Thailand produces itself as a transit country in order to manage and control refugee and asylum seeker populations. Through several discursive and material tactics, including security spectacles, legal maneuvering, and migrant destitution, Thailand maintains and exploits the status of a ‘transit country.' The purposeful construction of a place where ‘no one will stay' challenges depictions of migration as linear movements defined by sources and destinations, where transit spaces become only more distance to traverse. While the production of transit countries has always been political, the case of Thailand suggests that the politics involved need not center the migration deterrence efforts of traditional destination countries of the Global North, but have implications within states and regions of the Global South as well.},

abstract = {Capture and geological storage of CO2 is emerging as an attractive means of economically abating anthropogenic CO2 emissions from point sources. However, for the technology to be widely deployed it is essential that a reliable means to assess a site for both storage performance and regulation compliance exists. Hence, the ability to identify the origin of any CO2 seepage measured at the near-surface and ground surface and determine if it originates from a deep storage site or a different source is critical. As an analogue for post-emplacement seepage, here we examine natural CO2 rich springs and groundwater wells in the vicinity of the St. Johns Dome CO2 reservoir located on the border of Mid-Arizona/New Mexico, USA. Extensive travertine deposits in the region document a long history of migration of CO2 rich fluids to the surface. The presence of CO2 rich fluids today are indicated by high levels of HCO3
- in surface spring and groundwater well waters. We document measurements of dissolved noble gases and carbon isotopes from these springs and wells. We show that a component of the He fingerprint measured in gaseous CO2 sampled in the deep reservoir, can be traced along a fault plane to occur in waters from both groundwater wells and the majority of springs emerging at the surface above the reservoir. Our results show for the first time that CO2 can be fingerprinted from source to surface using noble gases and illustrates that this technique could be used to identify dissolved CO2 migration from engineered storage sites. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Previously, such methods have been tested on hydrothermal deposits, which are characterised by high Ra and U. We calculate a 226Ra age estimate of 2.9±0.4ka (1$\sigma$) for Holocene travertine that is in reasonable agreement with archaeological evidence by assuming that the 226Ra initial activity of the Holocene travertine is comparable with that of present-day carbonate deposits in the same area. We also investigate the use of Ba to normalise 226Ra activities. Comparison of age estimates based on Ra methods with ages derived from alpha-spectrometric 230Th/234U isochron techniques for the same co-eval sub-samples indicates that, where only alpha-spectrometric methods are available, the former are likely to be much more useful for Holocene travertine material, especially if there is a significant detrital component.},

This paper overviews the existing literature on the subject and analyzes primary data collected by the computer-assisted web-interviewing (CAWI) method. The questionnaire developed by the authors was completed by 269 residents of three Polish regions. The respondents evaluated the quality of their residential environment and identified environmental factors that could influence their health. The data were processed statistically to reveal that price is the most important factor behind the residential location choice. Other factors identified by the respondents included the sense of security and a quiet neighborhood. High scenic value was regarded as a moderately important factor, although its significance was recognized by the majority of the respondents.},

abstract = {Soil contamination by heavy metals is an important problem in many countries. As a first step in mitigating the related health risks, one has to delineate zones where metal concentrations exceed tolerable levels. Predictions of metal concentrations are usually required for blocks because remediation or regulatory decisions are imposed for entire parcels. Parcel areas typically exceed the observation support, but are smaller than the survey domain. Mapping soil pollution involves therefore a local change of support. Using data from an extensive survey of heavy metals in the soils around a metal smelter, we validate in this study geostatistical block predictions with measured heavy metal concentrations that were representative for the mean metal content on 53 parcels with areas of 500-5500m2. Block predictions were computed by conditional simulations (CS) and several variants of lognormal universal (LUK), constrained (LCK) and covariance-matching constrained (LCMCK) block kriging from observations with quasi-point support (2-100m2). Lognormal block kriging predictions were either computed based on the assumption that both observations and block means are lognormally distributed or by averaging lognormal point kriging predictions. Target quantities were the block means of metal content in 0-20cm depth and exceedance of regulatory thresholds by these means. CS gave the most precise predictions, both of block means and of threshold exceedance. However, the advantage was not pronounced: LUK, although slightly negatively biased, predicted block means nearly as well and was not much worse than LCK, LCMCK or CS when predicting threshold exceedance. LCK was partly positively biased (in particular when averaging lognormal constrained point kriging predictions) and was clearly less precise than LUK and CS when predicting block means. All four methods predicted threshold exceedance with good success as judged by the areas under Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (0.78-0.92). The good performance of LUK was rather surprising because nonlinear transforms of customary block kriging predictions are commonly known to be biased because kriging predictions are smoother than the target quantities. The relative success of LUK must be attributed to dense soil sampling around the validation parcels that dominantly lay in the severely contaminated part of the survey domain where a lot of soil samples had been taken. When sampling is dense the smoothing bias of block kriging does not matter much. In this situation, we can expect only limited gains in the precision of predictions by more sophisticated methods such as CS and LCK. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

To allow for price developments that can differ by quality, we use a recently developed generalization of the conventional Muth model that assumes a constant unit price across the quality spectrum. It allows us to separately consider the development of house prices and quality in Copenhagen neighbourhoods. Moreover, we investigate the validity of the common assumption of a constant unit price and reject it decisively. We use detailed housing transaction data for the greater Copenhagen area. We show that the housing boom of the 2000's and the bust that followed hit the lowest quality segments significantly harder than the high quality segments of the housing market.},

This study investigated the clinical and histologic variables that determine the chances of dialysis independence, dialysis dependence, or death after 12 mo in these patients. Sixty-nine patients who had ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis and were dialysis dependent at diagnosis received uniform, standard immunosuppressive therapy plus either intravenous methylprednisolone or plasma exchange. Eleven clinical and histologic variables were assessed. Univariate and binary logistic regression analyses were performed. Predictive parameters were entered into a two-step binary logistic regression analysis to differentiate among the outcomes of dialysis independence, dialysis dependence, or death. The point at which the chance of therapy-related death exceeded the chance of dialysis independence was determined. The chance of recovery exceeded the chance of dying in most cases. Intravenous methylprednisolone as adjunctive therapy plus {\textless}18{\%} normal glomeruli and severe tubular atrophy increased the chance of therapy-related death over the chance of dialysis independence. Plasma exchange treatment plus severe tubular atrophy and {\textless}2{\%} normal glomeruli increased the chance of therapy-related death over that of dialysis independence. Even with ominous histologic findings, the chance of renal recovery exceeds the chance of therapy-related death when these patients are treated with plasma exchange as adjunctive therapy.

abstract = {Two main deep saline aquifers have been identified in the Paris basin for possible CO2 injection: carbonate reservoirs from the Dogger and Triassic sandstones. These two targeted reservoirs are located at convenient depths for supercritical CO2 storage between 1500 and 2500 m in the center of the Paris basin and show good sealing properties on the upper cap rock. To control long term storage efficiency of CCS projects it is essential to design and implement an appropriate monitoring program that proves that CO 2 can be stored safely for a long time. A future monitoring program will be focused on three main axes: a geophysical, geochemical and biological. This paper presents the global monitoring methodology developed to address geochemical aspects of future CO2 storage sites. Three major compartments must be monitored for a well representative CO2 flow baseline: the geosphere, biosphere and atmosphere compartments of the specific site. Viability of any CCS project is strongly dependent on the of our capacity to well establish a realistic quantitative baseline system integrating natural and anthropogenic contributions in each compartment. For these reasons, our technical strategy must a combination of in situ and continuous monitoring systems. On the basis of previous and present day research programs conducted on natural CO2 storage sites, an in-situ monitoring combined methodology matrix adapted to CO2 storage at Claye-Souilly site in Paris basin deep saline aquifer is argued. The presentation will also integrate the proposal of new development in optical sensors (Infrared, Raman and Laser) for gas quantification and traceability including the isotopic aspects. Geosphere monitoring strategy must be mainly conducted through an original multi packers system allowing simultaneously reservoir, rock formations and strategic aquifers observations. In the reservoir, continuous acquisition of geochemical and hydrodynamic parameters is of first importance for adjusting and limiting the divergence criteria of the models and to adapt the injection procedure. In upper rock formations, establishment and modeling of gas transfer curves, will constitute a sensitive and powerful in-situ leakage detector tool. Biosphere survey strategy can be based on conventional accumulation chambers and dynamic flow chambers systems. The surface sampling network must be adapted on the basis of geological and structural characteristics of overburden rock as revealed by previous geophysical investigations. A remote infrared scanning sensing system combined with a laser remote system must support the atmosphere compartment survey strategy. The use of such combined remote system yields a spatial and temporal imaging of the CO2 and its dynamics in air. Sensitivity of leakage detection will depend on the chosen sensing system and the amount of CO2 injected. While variability of CO2 flux and concentration vary with time and with geographic location, they will both depend on the investigated compartment, the natural carbon cycle and the anthropogenic events. Both, sensitivity and variability should be considered in order to establish the alert levels. Given the complexity of data, the time needed to quantify sensitivity and, variability aspects and to establish a base line system, must be longer than one year (one seasonal cycle). This aspect is of first importance to define and provide the remediation operations that must be applied in the case of CO2 leakage on the basis of combined deep, surface and sub-surface measured gas data. Compilation of previous experiments strongly argued that our capacity to quantify variability of CO2 flux/concentration baseline must be one major key factor in the choice of a future monitoring program for CO2 storage site. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A novel solid amine sorbent was prepared using KIT-6-type mesoporous silica modified with tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA). Its adsorption behavior toward CO(2) from simulated flue gases is investigated using an adsorption column. The adsorption capacities at temperatures of 303, 313, 333, 343, and 353 K are 2.10, 2.29, 2.58, 2.85, and 2.71 mmol g(-1), respectively. Experimental adsorption isotherms were obtained, and the average isosteric heat of adsorption was 43.8 kJ/mol. The adsorption capacity increases to 3.2 mmol g(-1) when the relative humidity (RH) of the simulated flue gas reaches 37{\{}{\%}{\}}. The adsorption capacity is inhibited slightly by the presence of SO(2) at concentrations lower than 300 ppm but is not significantly influenced by NO at concentrations up to 400 ppm. The adsorbent is completely regenerated in 10 min at 393 K and a pressure of 5 KPa, with expected consumption energy of about 1.41 MJ kg(-1) CO(2).

abstract = {Norway is considered to be one of the most radon-affected areas in Europe. Based on results of nationwide surveys, the mean radon concentration in Norwegian dwellings has been estimated to be 89 Bq/m3, and 9{\%} of houses have an annual mean radon concentration exceeding the recommended action level of 200 Bq/m3. Very high radon concentrations (50,000 Bq/m3) have been recorded in houses located on highly permeable sediments. In some of these areas, more than 2/3 of the housing stock exceeds the action level. In most of these areas, the external background level and the concentration of radium in geological samples near the surface are moderate or low (less than 100 Bq/kg) and the high levels are due to transport of radon from large volumes of permeable material surrounding the construction. High indoor radon concentrations (above 10,000 Bq/m3) have also been recorded in areas of exposed bedrock with elevated levels of radium and in areas of moderately permeable sediments containing radium rich rock fragments such as alum shale and uranium-rich granites. The identification of high radon areas in Norway is based on extensive municipal surveys with measurements most sparsely populated areas. In a sample, where 2-20{\%} of houses in municipalities were randomly selected, depending on their population density (2{\%} in the most densely populated areas and 20 in the most sparsely populated areas). So far, nearly 200 out of 435 municipalities have carried out radon surveys in accordance with the mapping strategy recommended by NRPA. In this paper, results and characteristics of some of the high radon areas will be briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the risk of lung cancer associated with exposure at home to the radioactive disintegration products of naturally occurring radon gas. DESIGN Collaborative analysis of individual data from 13 case-control studies of residential radon and lung cancer. SETTING Nine European countries. SUBJECTS 7148 cases of lung cancer and 14,208 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relative risks of lung cancer and radon gas concentrations in homes inhabited during the previous 5-34 years measured in becquerels (radon disintegrations per second) per cubic metre (Bq/m3) of household air. RESULTS The mean measured radon concentration in homes of people in the control group was 97 Bq/m3, with 11{\%} measuring {\textgreater} 200 and 4{\%} measuring {\textgreater} 400 Bq/m3. For cases of lung cancer the mean concentration was 104 Bq/m3. The risk of lung cancer increased by 8.4{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 3.0{\%} to 15.8{\%}) per 100 Bq/m3 increase in measured radon (P = 0.0007). This corresponds to an increase of 16{\%} (5{\%} to 31{\%}) per 100 Bq/m3 increase in usual radon--that is, after correction for the dilution caused by random uncertainties in measuring radon concentrations. The dose-response relation seemed to be linear with no threshold and remained significant (P = 0.04) in analyses limited to individuals from homes with measured radon {\textless} 200 Bq/m3. The proportionate excess risk did not differ significantly with study, age, sex, or smoking. In the absence of other causes of death, the absolute risks of lung cancer by age 75 years at usual radon concentrations of 0, 100, and 400 Bq/m3 would be about 0.4{\%}, 0.5{\%}, and 0.7{\%}, respectively, for lifelong non-smokers, and about 25 times greater (10{\%}, 12{\%}, and 16{\%}) for cigarette smokers. CONCLUSIONS Collectively, though not separately, these studies show appreciable hazards from residential radon, particularly for smokers and recent ex-smokers, and indicate that it is responsible for about 2{\%} of all deaths from cancer in Europe.},

abstract = {Population numbers at local levels are fundamental data for many applications, including the delivery and planning of services, election preparation, and response to disasters. In resource-poor settings, recent and reliable demographic data at subnational scales can often be lacking. National population and housing census data can be outdated, inaccurate, or missing key groups or areas, while registry data are generally lacking or incomplete. Moreover, at local scales accurate boundary data are often limited, and high rates of migration and urban growth make existing data quickly outdated. Here we review past and ongoing work aimed at producing spatially disaggregated local-scale population estimates, and discuss how new technologies are now enabling robust and cost-effective solutions. Recent advances in the availability of detailed satellite imagery, geopositioning tools for field surveys, statistical methods, and computational power are enabling the development and application of approaches that can estimate population distributions at fine spatial scales across entire countries in the absence of census data. We outline the potential of such approaches as well as their limitations, emphasizing the political and operational hurdles for acceptance and sustainable implementation of new approaches, and the continued importance of traditional sources of national statistical data.},

abstract = {Geostatistics provides a popular framework for deriving high-resolution quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) by combining radar and rain gauge data. However, the skewed and heteroscedastic nature of precipitation is in contradiction to assumptions of classical geostatistics. This study examines the potential of trans-Gaussian kriging to overcome this contradiction. Combination experiments are undertaken with kriging with external drift (KED) using several settings of the Box-Cox transformation. Hourly precipitation data in Switzerland for the year 2008 serve as test bed to compare KED with and without transformation. The impact of transformation is examined with regard to compliance with model assumptions, accuracy of the point estimate, and reliability of the probabilistic estimate. Data transformation improves the compliance with model assumptions, but some level of contradiction remains in situations with many dry gauges. Very similar point estimates are found for KED with untransformed and appropriately transformed data. However, care is needed to avoid excessive transformation (close to log) because this can introduce a positive bias. Strong benefits from transformation are found for the probabilistic estimate, which is rendered positively skewed, sensitive to precipitation amount, and quantitatively more reliable. Without transformation, 44{\%} of all precipitation observations larger than 5 mm h(-1) are considered as extremely unlikely by the probabilistic estimate in the test application. Transformation reduces this rate to 4{\%}. Although transformation cannot fully remedy the complications for geostatistics in radar-gauge combination, it seems a useful procedure if realistic and reliable estimation uncertainties are desired, such as for the stochastic simulation of QPE ensembles.},

abstract = {A four-stage soil gas monitoring study was conducted from March 2007 to March 2010 in the western Port Campbell Embayment of the onshore Otway Basin, SE Australia. This study evaluated existing vadose zone soil gases over the CO2CRC Otway Project's site for CO2 storage, and nearby deep natural CO2 accumulations. Carbon dioxide, methane and helium were the main gases analysed and much of the time CH4 concentrations were too low for accurate analysis. Carbon dioxide concentrations ranged from atmospheric background levels of 0.033 {\%} up to about 10 {\%} of the total soil gas. The ???13CCO2 values are typical for organic matter decomposition as the main source of the CO2 in the soil gas. Modern radiocarbon ages, determined from 14C analysis, and low helium concentrations support the conclusion that CO2 in the soil gas is predominantly from modern organic sources. There was a relative increase in CO2 concentration measured in locations where the Port Campbell Limestone is near the ground surface, which implies additional CO2 has been produced from the weathering of limestone. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We used the multiphase and multicomponent TOUGH2/EOS7CA model to carry out predictive simulations of CO2 injection into the shallow subsurface of an agricultural field in Bozeman, Montana. The purpose of the simulations was to inform the choice of CO2 injection rate and design of monitoring and detection activities for a CO2 release experiment. The release experiment configuration consists of a long horizontal well (70 m) installed at a depth of approximately 2.5 m into which CO2 is injected to mimic leakage from a geologic carbon sequestration site through a linear feature such as a fault. We estimated the permeability of the soil and cobble layers present at the site by manual inversion of measurements of soil CO2 flux from a vertical-well CO2 release. Based on these estimated permeability values, predictive simulations for the horizontal well showed that CO2 injection just below the water table creates an effective gas-flow pathway through the saturated zone up to the unsaturated zone. Once in the unsaturated zone, CO2 spreads out laterally within the cobble layer, where liquid saturation is relatively low. CO2 also migrates upward into the soil layer through the capillary barrier and seeps out at the ground surface. The simulations predicted a breakthrough time of approximately two days for the 100kg d(-1) injection rate, which also produced a flux within the range desired for testing detection and monitoring approaches. The seepage area produced by the model was approximately five meters wide above the horizontal well, compatible with the detection and monitoring methods tested. For a given flow rate, gas-phase diffusion of CO2 tends to dominate over advection near the ground surface, where the CO2 concentration gradient is large, while advection dominates deeper in the system.},

abstract = {[ 1] In this paper we present the first geochemical data set regarding long-term monitoring of dissolved gases in thermal waters from a seismic area. Three sites in Umbria ( Central Apennines, Italy) were studied both for the chemical and for the helium isotopic composition of the dissolved gases. Data were collected during and after the seismic crisis that struck the region in 1997-1998. The chemical composition of the dissolved gases revealed that a CO2-rich gas phase was always mixed with an atmospheric-derived component dominated by N-2. A normal faulting marked the beginning of the seismic activity enhancing the release of CO2 on a regional scale. Variations in both the chemical and isotopic compositions of the dissolved gases were also observed as preseismic, synseismic, and postseismic phenomena related to the seismic shock of March 1998. Those geochemical modifications were interpreted as being the consequence of a drop in the CO2 degassing rate, in good agreement with the compressive focal mechanism of that seismic event. Furthermore, this interpretation was also consistent with the geologic and tectonic setting of the study area and induced us to postulate that changes in the local rock permeability, due to crustal deformations (i.e., coseismic deformation and postseismic release), were responsible for the geochemical modifications observed. On the basis of the foregoing, we have concluded that the geochemistry of dissolved gases in groundwaters represents a useful tool for the investigation of the relationships between circulating fluids and seismic activity.},

While traditional hedonic modeling assumes the existence of direct links between environmental factors and property values, this paper suggests that such links are indirect and work through the investment decisions of homeowners, who choose to invest (or not to invest) in the maintenance and/or expansion of their properties. To verify this assumption, HCMs accumulated in four residential neighborhoods in Haifa, Israel are analyzed. The findings indicate a fairly strong association between environmental factors, building characteristics, rehabilitation activity and property values in these neighborhoods.

Soil helium was studied at several transects crossing different structural features of the area. Radon concentration measured by Track-Etch ranged from 1.0 to 1990 pCi/l while that measured by emanometry ranged from 0.1 to 618 pCi/l. Soil helium concentration varied from 5250 to 15 560 ppb with an average value of 6197 ppb. The spatial distribution of soil radon correlates quite closely with structural features (fractures, emission centers, etc.), where the main geothermal manifestations (fumaroles, steam ground and high subsurface temperature and gas contents) also occur. Areas showing high soil Rn concentrations occur at the summit of Teide, Roques de Garc{\'{i}}a, caldera rim and south and east off side of the caldera. High soil helium anomalies correlate well spatially with those of radon, especially at the summit of Teide where relatively high 3He/4He isotopic ratios occur, suggesting a deep contribution for these emanations. Data indicate that radon and helium are supplied mostly from a deep source, with a minor contribution from U- and Th-rich shallow rocks and soils. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The success of geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration as a large-scale carbon management strategy is critically dependent on the ability of the geologic sinks and trapping mechanisms to confine the injected CO2 for hundreds to thousands of years. Leakage of CO2 from geologic sinks could result in significant release of the CO2 back to the atmosphere, potentially reducing, if not negating altogether, the benefits of geologic CO2 sequestration. For example, a leakage rate of 1{\%} per year from 1 billion tons of geologically stored CO2 (10 million tons) would exceed the current annual CO2 emissions from all the power plants in North Dakota (4 million tons). Further, leakage could have negative ecological effects and present the potential for health problems other than global warming. Clearly, the more CO2 that is stored, the greater the potential that leakage from geologic sinks could result in adverse environmental and atmospheric impacts. It has recently been proposed that leakage rates of 0.01{\%} per year be established as a performance requirement for geologically sequestered CO2 (White et al., 2003).This report provides an analysis of how the physicochemical properties of CO2 would affect its trapping potential and mobility in various types of geologic environments. Analog studies of geologic environments containing large, concentrated amounts of CO2 or hydrocarbons gas were also used to derive insight regarding the leakage processes that would be inherent in geologic CO2 sequestration. The analogs included a) naturally occurring deposits of high-purity CO2, b) a mature CO2 flood enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project, c) an aquifer natural gas storage reservoir, and d) coalbed natural gas deposits.Injected CO2 can be trapped in geologic sinks by four types of mechanisms. Different types of geologic sinks in combination with their site-specific properties would trap CO2 by different mechanisms. More than one type of trapping mechanism would typically be present in a single geologic sink. Most trapping mechanisms do not permanently immobilize CO2. Thus leakage of CO2 to the surface can potentially occur from all types of geologic sinks. In the right types of geologic settings, a large, concentrated amount of CO2 could be stored for a geologically long time period without the risk of significant CO2 leakageto the surface. The dominant, but by no means sole, barrier to CO2 leakage to the surface from geologic sinks is not the trapping mechanism(s) but rather the permeability characteristics of the rock layers overlying or adjacent to the geologic sinks. The hydrologic properties of the formations containing the geologic sinks would also affect the potential for CO2 leakage. Geologic settings with relatively static hydrology, i.e., low formation water velocity, would be preferable.},

abstract = {In Central Italy non-volcanic CO2 is discharged by focused degassing (strong diffuse emission and vents) and by high-CO2 groundwater. 3He/4He data and the carbon isotopic composition of CO2 are compatible with derivation from mantle degassing and/or metamorphic decarbonation. The gases produced at depth accumulate in permeable reservoirs composed of Mesozoic carbonates. When total pressure (roughly corresponding to pCO2) of the reservoir fluid exceeds hydrostatic pressure, a free gas phase forms gas reservoirs within the permeable host rocks from which gases may escape toward the surface. This process generates both the focused vents and the CO2-rich springs which characterise the study area. The storage and expulsion of CO2 is controlled by fractures and faults and/or structural highs of permeable carbonate formations. Influx of deep CO2 into the overlying groundwater yields a widespread elevated pCO2 anomaly in the Tyrrhenian Central Italy aquifers. These aquifers release CO2 to the atmosphere when groundwater is discharged at the surface from springs. The groundwater degassing flux is estimated from the carbon balance of regional aquifers computed by coupling aquifer geochemistry with isotopic and hydrogeological data. The resulting production rate of deep CO2 ranges from 4 x 105 to 9 x 106 mol y-1 km-2. In concert with the regional geologic setting, the deep CO2 production rate increases westward. In the aquifers with anomalously high pCO2, the average CO2 influx rate of the anomalous areas is several times higher than the value derived by Kerrick et al. [Kerrick, D.M., McKibben, M.A., Seward, T.M., Caldeira, K., 1995. Convective hydrothermal CO2 emission from high heat flow regions. Chem. Geol., 121 (1995) 285-293.] as baseline for CO2 emission from areas of high heat flow. The flux of CO2 lost to the atmosphere from water emitted from springs is of the same order of magnitude as the influx of deep CO2 into the aquifer.},

However, in order to model radon levels and dynamics in real houses, it is necessary to take into account all the parameters and processes affecting radon levels. This is the objective of the dynamic RAGENA model of radon generation, entry and accumulation indoors. The model has been adapted to a Mediterranean climate house under dynamic conditions, and the indoor radon and soil radon dynamics have been compared to experimental results. It has been found (i) that the model gives a soil radon dynamics similar to that obtained experimentally, (ii) a remarkable model-experiment agreement indoors and (iii) that the indoor radon dynamics is given by a permanent radon entry from building materials and a dynamic removal through ventilation, which is driven by indoor-outdoor temperature differences and wind speed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {There has been a considerable increase on research of the ecological consequences of microplastics released into the environment, but only a handful of works have focused on the nano-sized particles of polymer-based materials. Though their presence has been difficult to adequately ascertain, due to the inherent technical difficulties for isolating and quantifying them, there is an overall consensus that these are not only present in the environment - either directly released or as the result of weathering of larger fragments - but that they also pose a significant threat to the environment and human health, as well. The reduced size of these particulates ({\textless}1 $\mu$m) makes them susceptible of ingestion by organisms that are at the base of the food-chain. Moreover, the characteristic high surface area-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles may add to their potential hazardous effects, as other contaminants, such as persistent organic pollutants, could be adsorbed and undergo bioaccumulation and bioamplification phenomena. In this review, we describe the most relevant sources of nanoplastics and offer some insights into their fate once released into the environment. Furthermore, we overviewthemost prominent effects of these small particulates, while identifying the key challenges scientists currently face in the research of nanoplastics in the environment. Lastly, we give a brief summary of the economic impacts of the pollution caused by plastic litter - a potential key source of nanoplastics - in the oceans, the most common destination of these contaminants.},

abstract = {Lake basins (??? 2.7 ?? 106 km2, about 0.8{\%} of the ocean surface or 2{\%} of the land surface) bury a surprisingly high amount of atmospheric carbon (??? 70 ?? 106 t/a) which reaches more than one fourth of the annual atmospheric carbon burial in the modern oceans. This is mainly accomplished by the rapid accumulation of lacustrine sediments and a very high preservation factor (on average 50 times higher than that in the oceans). Lakes with relatively large drainage areas commonly display the highest carbon accumulation rates. In most cases, burial of organic matter is more important than that of carbonate carbon produced by silicate weathering, in contrast to the oceans where the burial of atmospheric carbonate carbon almost reaches the same amount as that of organic carbon. Exceptions to this rule are closed lake basins in arid to semiarid climate which precipitate a major part of their atmosphere-derived dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as carbonate. These results are demonstrated in some detail for L. Qinghai, China, (low contribution of atmospheric carbonate carbon) and L. Turkana, East Africa, (high contribution from silicate rocks). Further data are gained by estimates for a number of closed and open lakes. The drainage areas of the lakes withdraw atmospheric carbon at rates of mostly 1-4 g/m2/a, calculated from the lacustrine carbon burial. Carbon burial rates in lakes commonly increase with change to wetter and warmer climate (partially larger lake surfaces, higher rates of seasonal carbonate precipitation, trend to stratified lake waters with oxygen-deficient bottom water). Anthropogenic influence mostly enhances the production and preservation of organic carbon in lake basins (often by a factor of 3-4). After the last glacial maximum, the joint action of the globally spreading vegetation, peat growth, and carbon burial in lakes would have been able to reduce the atmospheric carbon pool to one third to one half of its present amount within a time period of 1 ka. However, CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean has brought about an overall increase in the atmospheric CO2 during the Holocene. The contribution of lakes and artificial reservoirs in counteracting man-made CO2 emissions should not be neglected. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Detection and quantification of different gas species in the vadose zone of soils and/or in the atmospheric boundary layer is a key method in many fields of environmental research and also considered as one element of monitoring related to carbon storage operations. We have developed a robust and economic continuous soil gas monitoring system, which requires little maintenance and includes an automatic data transfer. We report on one of the largest continuous baseline data sets ever recorded. They were acquired during a long-term (up to 4 years) continuous soil gas monitoring program completed during a case study in the Altmark area (Germany). Permanent monitoring stations were operated at 12 well sites and one reference location.We detected considerable and site specific variations of CO2 concentration at shallow depths (1-3m), which show that soil gas baseline concentrations, including quantification of variations caused by natural influences, can only be performed by means of a long-term continuous monitoring with reasonably short measuring intervals. The major result from the analysis of the data set is that much of the complexity of soil gas monitoring can be avoided if the correct sites and depths are chosen. In particular, we can demonstrate that CO2 concentrations are very stable over long time periods (more than one year) when measured below the biological active soil zone (here at 0.5m depth in average) and above the water table, where they are marginally touched by atmospheric influences. Seasonal variations trend to level out providing a constant signal over longer time periods (weeks/months).Applying a simplified non-steady state 1D-diffusion leakage model to the data set reveals that CO2 concentration is quite sensitive to additional leakage in this stable zone, both in terms of concentration increase and response time. Monitoring in deeper parts of the soil column is much more sensitive to additional seepage than surface emission measurements. For the study site, we have developed criteria for rating the effectiveness of the monitoring locations based on absolute and variability of the carbon dioxide concentration, the local water level fluctuations and estimated seepage rates. The evaluation of ??13C isotopic composition of background CO2 at deeper measuring intervals shows that ??13C can discriminate leakage even when isotopic composition of injected CO2 is similar to soil CO2. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses that the Frio brine pilot experiment is designed to test storage performance of a typical subsurface environment in an area where large-volume sources and sinks are abundant. Extensive pre-experiment characterization was employed and modeling to identify significant factors that increase or decrease risk of leakage from the injection zone. The experiment to focus on those factors was designed, as well as to test for presence or absence of events that are not expected. A fully developed reservoir model of heterogeneous reworked fluvial sandstones of the Frio formation documents three-dimensional compartmentalization of the injection horizon by faulting associated with salt-dome intrusion and growth. Modeling using the TOUGH2 simulator showed that a significant source of uncertainty for subsurface performance of injected CO2 is residual CO2 saturation during storage. The experiment is therefore designed to monitor plume geometry and CO2 saturation near the injection well and closely spaced observation well. Leakage out of the injection zone as a result of well engineering or other flaws in the seal is also monitored in the sandstone immediately overlying the injection zone and at the surface using multiple techniques. Permitting strategies include cooperation among two state agencies, as well as federal national energy policy act (NEPA) assessment, because of the innovative aspects of the experiment. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Many studies have evaluated the behavior of the elements represented in the U- and Th-decay series in the hydrosphere. The general features of these elements are reviewed in this chapter, including the extent to which adsorption and precipitation control aquifer. The modeling approach that underlies most U- and Th-decay series radionuclide transport studies is also described in the chapter. The decay series nuclides have been shown to provide constraints on the behavior of each of the elements involved. Ra isotopes can provide a range of tools for calculating groundwater chemistry parameters. The (226Ra/228Ra) ratios can be used to look at relative recoil rates between decay chains, the (224Ra/222Rn) ratios can be used to obtain values for KRa, and the (223Ra/226Ra) ratios can be used to look at non-steady state conditions. Values of 103–104 for KRa have been calculated for a range of aquifer lithologies. It has been suggested that under natural conditions, Ra can migrate at rates of 10−3–10−4 times that of the groundwater, and so is significantly retarded by adsorption. The chapter also shows that short-lived Th isotopes are strongly absorbed on aquifer materials and readily provide Th retardation factors that are orders of magnitude greater than Ra. U isotope compositions potentially can provide an important tool for tracing groundwater from different aquifer conditions, and under some circumstances may be used to provide groundwater ages.},

abstract = {The first comprehensive geochemical data-set of the fluids circulating over a 14,000 km2-wide seismic-prone area of the Southern Apennines, Calabria Region (Italy), is presented here. The geochemical investigations were carried out with the twofold aim of constraining the origin and interactions of the circulating fluids and to investigate possible relationships with local faults. Sixty samples of both thermal and cold waters were collected, from which the dissolved gases were extracted. The geochemical features of the water samples display different types and degrees of water-rock interactions, irrespective of the outlet temperature. The calculated equilibrium temperatures of the thermal waters (60-160 ??C) and the low heat flow of the whole study area, are consistent with a heating process due to deep water circulation and rapid upflow through lithospheric structures. The composition of the dissolved gases reveals that crustal-originating gases (N2 and CO2-dominated) feed all the groundwaters. The 3He/4He ratios of the dissolved He, in the range of 0.03-0.22Rac for the thermal waters and 0.05-0.63Rac for the cold waters (Rac = He isotope ratio corrected for atmospheric contamination), are mainly the result of a two-component (radiogenic and atmospheric) mixing, although indications of mantle-derived He are found in some cold waters. As the study area had been hit by 18 of the most destructive earthquakes (magnitude ranging from 5.9 to 7.2) occurring over a 280-a time span (1626-1908) in the Southern Apennines, the reported results on the circulating fluids may represent the reference for a better inside knowledge of the fault-fluid relationships and for the development of long-term geochemical monitoring strategies for the area. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This research aims at integrating remote sensing data and field studies to prospect for radioactive materials at Gabal El Sela area, South Eastern Desert of Egypt. This area is a part of the Arabo-Nubian shield, which is constituted by Late Precambrian basement rocks and developed during the Pan African tectono-thermal event. Geological interpretation of Landsat ETM+ image and field studies revealed that the study area is mainly covered by ophiolitic ultramafic rocks, intermediate metavolocanics, granodiorites, biotite granites and garnetiferous muscovite granites. These rocks are injected by pegmatitic and quartz veins and cut by acidic and basic dykes. The processed Landsat ETM+ data enable also to identify uraniferous alteration zones hosted in the granitic rocks (using band ratio 5/7, 4/5, 3/1 in RGB, density slicing and supervised classification techniques). The measured reflectance values (DNs) of six spectral bands of Landsat ETM+ for all exposed rock types in the study area show that the alteration zones have the highest reflectance values. The study recorded the presence of uranium mineralizations in alteration zones associating with the granitic rocks occurring along ENE-WSW trending shear zones. Three uranium-bearing alteration zones hosted in granitic rocks were detected. These zones are characterized by ferrugination, silicification, grizenization and kaolinitization. The most promising alteration zones (Site 1) occurs at the northeastern part of Gabal El Sela and is characterized by very high radioactive anomalies (up to 5000 ppm eU). Microprobe analyses of samples collected from these alteration zones reveal the presence of uraninite crystals. It seems that the high fractures density of the granitic rocks acted as good channels for the ascending hydrothermal fluids and the percolating meteoric water, that leached the uranium minerals disseminated all over the rocks and redeposited them along the fractures of the shear zones. This study demonstrates the utility of orbital remote sensing data for finding unknown mineralized zones in the Eastern Desert of Egypt and similar arid regions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.},

This paper summarizes and compares the features, events, and processes that can be identified from these analogues, which include both naturally occurring releases and those associated with industrial processes. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) carbon dioxide can accumulate beneath, and be released from, primary and secondary shallower reservoirs with capping units located at a wide range of depths; (2) many natural releases of CO2 are correlated with a specific event that triggered the release; (3) unsealed fault and fracture zones may act as conduits for CO2 flow from depth to the surface; (4) improperly constructed or abandoned wells can rapidly release large quantities of CO2; (5) the types of CO2 release at the surface vary widely between and within different leakage sites; (6) the hazard to human health was small in most cases, possibly because of implementation of post-leakage public education and monitoring pro- grams; (7) while changes in groundwater chemistry were related to CO2 leakage, waters often remained potable. Lessons learned for risk assessment associated with geologic carbon sequestration are discussed. Electronic},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Although leakage from monitored CO2 injection sites has been minimal to non-existent, experience from the natural gas storage industry suggests that, if it becomes a widely deployed technology, leaks may be expected from some storage sites. Natural occurrences of CO2 in the geosphere, some of which have been exploited, provide insights into the types of emissions that might be expected from anthropogenic CO2 storage sites. CO2 emission sites are commonly found in clusters in CO2-prone geological provinces: the most common natural emissions sites in sedimentary basins consist of carbonated springs and mofettes. These represent at worst only a local hazard. In volcanic and hydrothermal provinces, more energetic emissions may occur due to active supply from degassing magma. These include rare, sudden emissions from fissures and craters that have caused fatalities. It is unlikely that such provinces would be considered for CO2 storage Major lake overturn events such as occurred at Lake Nyos in 1986 are considered highly unlikely to occur as a result of CO2 storage, not least because CO2 levels in lake waters can be monitored and remediated. Natural CO2 fields indicate that under favourable conditions CO2 can be retained in the subsurface for millions of years. The main risk from man-made CO2 storage sites that does not have any close analogy in nature is considered to be a well blowout. A blowout that took place at a natural CO2 field provides some indication of the likely hazard. ?? 2006 NERC.},

abstract = {Geological CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) is among the main near-term contenders for addressing the problem of global climate change. Even in a baseline scenario, with no comprehensive international climate policy, a moderate level of CCS technology is expected to be deployed, given the economic benefits associated with enhanced oil and gas recovery. With stringent climate change control, CCS technologies will probably be installed on an industrial scale. Geologically stored CO 2 , however, may leak back to the atmosphere, which could render CCS ineffective as climate change reduction option. This article presents a long-term energy scenario study for Europe, in which we assess the significance for climate policy making of leakage of CO 2 artificially stored in underground geological formations. A detailed sensitivity analysis is performed for the CO 2 leakage rate with the bottom-up energy systems model MARKAL, enriched for this purpose with a large set of CO 2 capture technologies (in the power sector, industry, and for the production of hydrogen) and storage options (among which enhanced oil and gas recovery, enhanced coal bed methane recovery, depleted fossil fuel fields, and aquifers). Through a series of model runs, we confirm that a leakage rate of 0.1{\%}/year seems acceptable for CCS to constitute a meaningful climate change mitigation option, whereas one of 1{\%}/year is not. CCS is essentially no option to achieve CO 2 emission reductions when the leakage rate is as high as 1{\%}/year, so more reductions need to be achieved through the use of renewables or nuclear power, or in sectors like industry and transport. We calculate that under strict climate control policy, the cumulative captured and geologically stored CO 2 by 2100 in the electricity sector, when the leakage rate is 0.1{\%}/year, amounts to about 45,000 MtCO 2 . Only a little over 10,000 MtCO 2 cumulative power-generation-related emissions are captured and stored underground by the end of the century when the leakage rate is 1{\%}/year. Overall marginal CO 2 abatement costs increase from a few €/tCO today to well over 150 €/tCO 2 in 2100, under an atmospheric CO 2 concentration constraint of 550 ppmv. Carbon costs in 2100 turn out to be about 40 €/tCO 2 higher when the annual leakage rate is 1{\%}/year in comparison to when there is no CO 2 leakage. Irrespective of whether CCS deployment is affected by gradual CO 2 seepage, the annual welfare loss in Europe induced by the implementation of policies preventing “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” (under our assumption, implying a climate stabilisation target of 550 ppmv CO 2 concentration) remains below 0.5{\%} of GDP during the entire century.},

abstract = {Spatial distribution of soil Hg, B and NH4 was investigated in the soils of Ca??adas caldera, Canary Islands, in the summer of 1992. Soil Hg, B and NH4 were also studied over several transects intersecting structural features. Soil Hg concentration ranged from 10.83 to 45,000 ??g kg-1 whereas those of B and NH4 ranged from 8.45 to 4512 ??g kg-1 and from 0.31 to 181 mg kg-1, respectively. Probability plot analysis identified 3 geochemical populations for Hg and B whereas only 2 were detected for NH4. Multivariate analysis (cluster, factor and multiple regression analysis) was used to identify subtle geochemical characteristics of the groups and factors and to determine the relationship between Hg, B and NH4 and the soil secondary parameters. High soil Hg, B and NH4 concentrations are interpreted as being related to areas where a convection system has developed, coinciding with the most recent volcanic centers located along the basaltic rift zones and with the main features inside Ca??adas caldera: Teide volcano and Roques de Garc??a. Background levels of soil volatiles are present in locations where no indication of subsurface thermal activity occurs. Generally, the secondary controls on Hg, B and NH4 are subtle and are overwhelmed in areas characterized by subsurface geothermal activity. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper discusses advantages and shortcomings of the S environment for multivariable geostatistics, in particular when extended with the gstat package, an extension package for the S environments (R, S-Plus). The gstat S package provides multivariable geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, as well as several visualisation functions. In particular, it makes the calculation, simultaneous fitting, and visualisation of a large number of direct and cross (residual) variograms very easy. Gstat was started 10 years ago and was released under the GPL in 1996; gstat.org was started in 1998. Gstat was not initially written for teaching purposes, but for research purposes, emphasising flexibility, scalability and portability. It can deal with a large number of practical issues in geostatistics, including change of support (block kriging), simple/ordinary/universal (co)kriging, fast local neighbourhood selection, flexible trend modelling, variables with different sampling configurations, and efficient simulation of large spatially correlated random fields, indicator kriging and simulation, and (directional) variogram and cross variogram modelling. The formula/models interface of the S language is used to define multivariable geostatistical models. This paper introduces the gstat S package, and discusses a number of design and implementation issues. It also draws attention to a number of papers on integration of spatial statistics software, GIS and the S environment that were presented on the spatial statistics workshop and sessions during the conference Distributed Statistical Computing 2003. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Groundwater flow and composition were monitored biannually in two overlying aquifers between June 2006 and March 2011, spanning the pre-, syn- and post-injection periods. The shallower ({\~{}}0-100m), unconfined, porous and karstic aquifer of the Port Campbell Limestone and the deeper ({\~{}}600-900m), confined and porous aquifer of the Dilwyn Formation contain valuable fresh to brackish water resources. Groundwater levels in either aquifer have not been affected by the drilling, pumping and injection activities that were taking place, or by the rainfall increase during the project. In terms of groundwater composition, the Port Campbell Limestone groundwater is brackish (electrical conductivity=801-3900??Scm-1), cool (temperature=12.9-22.5??C), and near-neutral (pH=6.62-7.45), whilst the Dilwyn Aquifer groundwater is fresher (electrical conductivity=505-1473??Scm-1), warmer (temperature=42.5-48.5??C), and more alkaline (pH=7.43-9.35). Carbonate dissolution, evapotranspiration and cation exchange control the composition of the groundwaters. Comparing the chemical and isotopic composition of the groundwaters collected before, during and after injection shows no statistically significant changes; even if they were statistically significant, they are mostly not consistent with those expected if CO2 addition had taken place. The monitoring program reveals no impact on the groundwater resources attributable to the C storage demonstration project. ?? 2012.},

Analysis includes review of 81 national and regional indoor radon surveys with varying sampling pattern, sample size and duration of measurements and detailed consideration of two regional surveys (Sverdlovsk oblast, Russia and Ni{\v{s}}ka Banja, Serbia). The analysis of the geometric standard deviation revealed that main factors influencing the dispersion of indoor radon concentration over the territory are as follows: area of territory, sample size, characteristics of measurements technique, the radon geogenic potential, building construction characteristics and living habits. As shown for Sverdlovsk oblast and Ni{\v{s}}ka Banja town the dispersion as quantified by GSD is reduced by restricting to certain levels of control factors.

abstract = {The natural radioactive gas radon is widely present in the built environment and at high concentrations is associated with enhanced risk of lung-cancer. This risk is significantly enhanced for habitual smokers. Although populations with higher degrees of social deprivation are frequently exposed to higher levels of many health-impacting pollutants, a recent study suggests that social deprivation in the UK is associated with lower radon concentrations. The analysis reported here, based on published data on social deprivation and domestic radon in urban and rural settings in the English East Midlands, identifies a weak association between increasing deprivation and lower radon areas. This is attributed to the evolution of the major urban centres on low-permeability, clay-rich alluvial soils of low radon potential. In addition, the predominance of high-rise dwellings in towns and cities will further reduce average exposure to radon in populations in those areas.},

abstract = {Turrialba is a basaltic-andesitic stratovolcano (3340masl), in the Cordillera Volc??nica Central in Costa Rica. After the last eruption (1864-1866), volcanic manifestations were limited to weak fumarolic discharge (continuous since 1980) from the summit. From 1996 onward, the degassing activity has progressively been increasing, reaching its climax after 2005. New fumaroles have appeared in the Central and West summit craters, the latter now being the most active, and in the fracture system in between, showing sulphur deposits and progressively increasing degassing rate. In 2004, fumaroles and new fissures have appeared on the SW outer and SSW distal flanks, the latter being located along a major NE-oriented tectonic lineament. Fumarolic temperatures at the bottom of the West crater have increased from 88 to 282??C in early 2008. Changes in chemical and isotopic compositions of discharged fluids have shown a progressive enhancing of the magmatic signature since 2001. Since late 2007, SO2 flux, measured with mini-DOAS, has increased two orders of magnitude (1t/day in 2002 to 740t/day in January 2008). The enhanced gas discharge at Turrialba volcano has caused significant interference on tropospheric O3 measurements at 2-3km altitude {\~{}}50km W from the volcano. Seismic swarms followed an increasing trend consistent with that of the fumaroles. The maximum seismic activity to date, up to thousands of events/day, was recorded in mid 2007. An inflationary trend was observed in the crater area. In this paper we present for the first time all the available data on the activity of Turrialba volcano. New geophysical, geodetical and geochemical data and published geophysical and geochemical data are presented and discussed as a whole. The multidisciplinary approach indicated that from 1996 to 2009 three stages, deriving by the delicate equilibrium between the hydrothermal and the magmatic reservoirs, were recognized. The magmatic-dominated phase is still prevailing as evidenced by the fact that, while completing the present paper, on the 4th of January 2010 at 16.57 (GMT) a loud explosion occurred at the West crater and was followed by three others spaced out every 10. min. These events were interpreted as associated with phreatic eruptions. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Loizzo2011,
abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) geological storage relies on safe, long-term injection of large quantities of CO2 in underground porous rocks. Wells, whether they are the conduit of the pumped fluid or are exposed to CO2 in the storage reservoir (observation and old wells) are man-made disturbances to the geological storage complex, and are thus viewed by some as a possible risk factor to the containment of the injected CO 2. Wells are composite structures, with an inner steel pipe separated from the borehole rock wall by a thin cement sheath (???2 cm) that prevents vertical fluid migration. Both carbon steel and cement react in the presence of CO2, although evidence from production of CO2-rich fluids in the oil and gas industry and from lab experiments suggests that competent, defect-free cement offers an effective barrier to CO2 migration and leaks. However, reactivity of cement and steel may result in CO2 migration pathways degrading over time, thus in the leakage risk increasing during the life of the storage project. The issue then becomes how to best integrate preventive verification of zonal isolation/well integrity in the storage site monitoring plan. An analysis of the order of magnitude of possible CO2 leaks, and of their path to potable aquifers or the atmosphere, is also necessary to optimize the assurance (mitigation) monitoring of the storage site. Evidence gathered during the MovECBM project indicates that migration of small quantities of CO2 happened during injection in a coal seam in Southwest Poland. The evidence, gathered from casing and cement logging as well as soil gas monitoring over a 3-year period, was coupled with laboratory testing and extensive modeling of the chemo-mechanical behavior of cement and steel to determine if CO2 migration might have been responsible of the observed behavior. The three lines of evidence were: the detection of very small CO2 fluxes, coupled with less controversial helium concentration in soil; the occurrence of a thin pathway at the interface between cement and casing; and the change in mechanical properties of cement, suggestive of partial carbonation. Whereas the observations suggest that limited CO2 migration might have happened in the well, they are by no means proof that the migration did happen. Nonetheless, the integration of measurement and modeling yields important lessons for wellbore monitoring. First, it puts a probable ceiling on the order of magnitude of expected leaks from reasonably well-cemented wells at around 100 metric tons per year (less than 0.05{\%} of the injected mass in a well like Sleipner or In Salah). It also suggests that cement may be a very effective leak detector: exposure to CO2 modifies its mechanical properties, which in turn can be detected using cement evaluation logs. Finally, coupling with dispersion modeling suggests the precision and accuracy required from soil gas and atmospheric monitoring, as well as the placement of sampling points; it also suggest that hysteresis, due to the accumulation in CO2 in surface aquifers and to the time required for it to be transported to the survey points, may delay initial detection; the same hysteresis may at the same time prolong the occurrence of CO2 shows long after the leak has stopped. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Soil respiration is the primary path by which CO2 fixed by land plants returns to the atmosphere. Estimated at approximately 75 × 1015 gC/yr, this large natural flux is likely to increase due to changes in the Earth's condition. The objective of this paper is to provide a brief scientific review for policymakers who are concerned that changes in soil respiration may contribute to the rise in CO2 in Earth's atmosphere. Rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere will increase the flux of CO2 from soils, while simultaneously leaving a greater store of carbon in the soil. Traditional tillage cultivation and rising temperature increase the flux of CO2 from soils without increasing the stock of soil organic matter. Increasing deposi- tion of nitrogen from the atmosphere may lead to the sequestration of carbon in vegetation and soils. The response of the land biosphere to simultaneous changes in all of these factors is unknown, but a large increase in the soil carbon pool seems unlikely to moderate the rise in atmospheric CO2 during the next century.

Soil CO2 concentration varied significantly from atmospheric levels to 30{\%}, while soil CH4 and H-2 contents ranged from 5 to 851 ppm and from 0.5 to 620 ppm, respectively. Soil CO2, CH4 and H-2 distribution suggests that high diffuse degassing at Canadas caldera is volcanic-structurally controlled. Anomalous soil H-2 concentrations were identified at the summit of Teidei and outside caldera boundaries, where the most recent eruption of Tenerife island occurred. delta C-13-CO2 data showed a magmatic, mixed magmatic-biogenic, and biogenic origin while a biogenic origin is suggested For soil CH4 at Canadas caldera and its surroundings. By coupling the CO2/He-3 ratio with the He-3/He-4 ratio of fumarolic gas samples from the summit of Teide, we propose three possible sources for carbon: MORB-type, organic carbon and carbonate.

abstract = {Mediterranean soils under heathland are often shallow, with low capacity for water storage, and a high risk of erosion. In this context, recurrent wildfires can negatively affect their chemical and physical properties. Very little research has been carried out concerning the long-term variations on the ground surface after burning. The behaviour of plant communities and plant cover can regulate and control soil processes in the post-fire period, so that the evolution of vegetation communities must be taken into account when studying the evolution of soil processes after disturbance. In this study, the impact of fire on several physical and chemical soil properties has been investigated during 3. years after experimental burning in a Mediterranean heathland. On average, the soil organic matter content after the fire decreased strongly, and one year after the fire it did not vary substantially, although it increased slightly during the following two years until the end of experiments. Burning led to coarser texture immediately after fire, but clay content decreased strongly during the following 3. years due to post-fire erosion processes and selective detachment of fine particles. Soil pH and electrical conductivity increased ephemerally and returned to initial values just 1-year after the fire. Soil water repellency was partly destroyed by the scorching, but pre-fire proportion of water-repellent soil samples was observed just after 1. year. Water-repellent aggregates may have been removed by post-fire erosion, but water repellency also appears as a natural attribute of these soils. Reduction in organic matter content after the fire and changes in texture and water repellency contributed to a decreased stability of aggregates and an increased bulk density. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The optimal predictor and the measure of prediction uncertainty are computed through data augmentation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods; a less computationally demanding plug-in approach is also described. A brief description of a geostatistical method called indicator kriging is given as well as some of its shortcomings.

abstract = {Although statistically-derived national Seasonal Correction Factors (SCFs) are conventionally used to convert sub-year radon concentration measurements to an annual mean, it has recently been suggested that external temperature could be used to derive local SCFs for short-term domestic measurements. To validate this approach, hitherto unanalysed radon and temperature data from an environmentally-stable location were analysed. Radon concentration and internal temperature were measured over periods totalling 1025 days during an overall period of 1762 days, the greatest continuous sampling period being 334 days, with corresponding meteorological data collected at a weather station 10 km distant. Mean daily, monthly and annual radon concentrations and internal temperatures were calculated. SCFs derived using monthly mean radon concentration, external temperature and internal-external temperature-difference were cross-correlated with each other and with published UK domestic SCF sets. Relatively good correlation exists between SCFs derived from radon concentration and internal-external temperature difference but correlation with external temperature, was markedly poorer. SCFs derived from external temperature correlate very well with published SCF tabulations, confirming that the complexity of deriving SCFs from temperature data may be outweighed by the convenience of using either of the existing domestic SCF tabulations. Mean monthly radon data fitted to a 12-month sinusoid showed reasonable correlation with many of the annual climatic parameter profiles, exceptions being atmospheric pressure, rainfall and internal temperature. Introducing an additional 6-month sinusoid enhanced correlation with these three parameters, the other correlations remaining essentially unchanged. Radon latency of the order of months in moisture-related parameters suggests that the principal driver for radon is total atmospheric moisture content rather than relative humidity.},

abstract = {The European Union (EU) - just like the rest of the world - is faced with major challenges as regards energy and the environment: these include ever-increasing global demand for energy, volatile prices, rising emissions of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change, and unstable oil and gas supplies, with reserves concentrated in just a few countries. Urgent efforts are required if we are to prevent the worldwide energy situation from getting even worse. Developing new energy technologies can play a decisive role here and help to achieve the EU's goals of reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 20{\%} between now and 2020 and increasing by 20{\%} the share of renewable sources in Europe's energy mix. The EU therefore intends to adopt a European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) plan to speed up the development of clean, efficient and low-carbon technologies. The vital role of energy technologies Energy technologies have a key role to play in providing energy that is at once competitive and sustainable. Technology can bring substantial advances for energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources, the reduced use of fossil fuels, the gradual decarbonisation of transport and power stations, and the use of nuclear power. Also, information and communication technologies can help in managing and reducing energy demand. Energy technologies therefore not only play a part in ensuring secure, sustainable supplies at reasonable prices, but also contribute to growth and jobs in Europe. European-level research has already delivered results in this field - in increasing the output and lowering the costs of wind and photovoltaic energy, for example. European Technology Platforms have also been set up in order to coordinate efforts. Financial backing for research and demonstration will be provided under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development, with a 50{\%} increase in annual spending on energy research, and under the Intelligent Energy - Europe programme. More needs to be done, however. A European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) plan The SET plan will contribute to the development of a more sustainable energy system that is up to today's challenges. The plan will build up a portfolio of more efficient, cleaner and more competitive energy technologies. It will establish stable and predictable conditions for the finance sector and for companies, especially SMEs, developing, providing backing for, and/or disseminating these technologies. It will also influence European citizens' socio-economic behaviour by encouraging better energy use. The SET plan will help to drive the whole process of technological innovation from basic research through to commercial production. It will enable Community and national instruments to be used to the best possible effect, thus helping to accelerate technology development ("technology push"), in particular the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development, and market introduction ("demand pull"), especially the "Intelligent Energy - Europe" programme. The strategic element of the plan will be to identify those technologies for which it is essential to mobilise resources at European level in order to accelerate development and deployment. To achieve this in a targeted and coordinated way, the Commission proposes establishing firm partnerships, defining precise objectives and evaluating the associated risks and resources. Drawing up the SET plan The Commission intends to put forward a first European Strategic Energy Technology Plan at the Spring 2008 European Council, after consulting all stakeholders (industry, researchers, the finance sector, public authorities, energy consumers, civil society, unions). Background This communication is part of a package of measures setting out a European energy policy, as presented by the Commission on 10 January 2007.},

abstract = {The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) provides an interesting way of approximating the posterior marginals of a wide range of Bayesian hierarchical models. This approximation is based on conducting a Laplace approximation of certain functions and numerical integration is extensively used to integrate some of the models parameters out. The R-INLA package offers an interface to INLA, providing a suitable framework for data analysis. Although the INLA methodology can deal with a large number of models, only the most relevant have been implemented within R-INLA. However, many other important models are not available for R-INLA yet. In this paper we show how to fit a number of spatial models with R-INLA, including its interaction with other R packages for data analysis. Secondly, we describe a novel method to extend the number of latent models available for the model parameters. Our approach is based on conditioning on one or several model parameters and fit these conditioned models with R-INLA. Then these models are combined using Bayesian model averaging to provide the final approximations to the posterior marginals of the model. Finally, we show some examples of the application of this technique in spatial statistics. It is worth noting that our approach can be extended to a number of other fields, and not only spatial statistics.},

abstract = {A multiparametric study of Altamira cave conditions was performed to identify mechanisms that affect CO2. A daily survey was used to better understand the role of the shallow vadose system as a source/sink of this gas. Airborne particles were monitored to distinguish the air movement that was joined to ??13CO2 and were also used as a proxy of the origin of the CO2. A gas transport model has been created based on the interaction of three air masses (soil-cave-exterior), which is driven by soil-derived CO2 diffusion to the cave and by the advective mixing of the cave with exterior air. The diffusive process increases cave CO2 and decreases ??13CO2. The advective mixing induces a decrease in CO2 and an increase in the isotopic signal. The diffusive flux depends on soil CO2 production; the advective flux is driven by outer-inner density gradients, and both depend on the degree of exchange between air masses. Consequently, external conditions, such as temperature and humidity, regulate gas interchange. The created process-based model permits the quantification of CO2 fluxes. The consequence of the degassing stage is the release of light CO2 (??13C quantified in -24.82???) into the exterior air (??13C measured in -11.34???). The migration of gas in the vadose zone may influence many environmental processes, and therefore, the contribution of shallow underground systems to surface CO2 exchange and to the isotopic signal of troposphere should be accounted for. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Chemical analyses of water emanating from Fossil Springs in Central Arizona were conducted to predict changes in travertine deposition related to changes in stream discharge caused by diversion for hydroelectric power generation. During spring of 1996, water was sampled at 15 locations during normal seepage flow in a 6.7 km reach below Fossil Springs and at full baseflow during turbine maintenance. Analyses resulted in a rate of 11,923 kg d−1 of CaCO3 precipitated from 1218 l s−1 of water emanating from the springs, while flows of 5.6 l s−1 that seep past a diversion dam produced 46 kg d−1 of CaCO3 precipitation. Active travertine dams currently occur predominantly below the Irving hydroelectric powerplant with partial return of diverted flow back into the natural channel. The lower reach resulted in 519 kg d−1 of CaCO3 precipitated from the return of 56.6 l s−1 with a reduced rate of precipitation during surface runoff conditions due to a dilution effect. Artificial substrates were located at sites in the lower reach for comparison with mass transfer rates derived from changes in water chemistry. Comparison between actual precipitation rates and overall mass transfer rates suggested preferential deposition was occurring at dam locations. Rates of mass transfer for high flow were greater than lower flow. Overall, mass transfer rates for the upper reach were proportional to the flow velocities with total mass transfers for both flows being approximately equal.},

abstract = {The migration mechanisms of endogenous gases in the geosphere are defined in relation to the fluid-rock conditions and analyzed by basic transport equations. Upon examining the geological factors that influence the physical parameters in the equations in porous and fracture media, and considering the widespread high-permeability of deep subsurface rocks, in terms of fracture aperture, (orders of 10-2 to 101 mm at depths of thousands meters, as suggested by recent crustal surveys) advection of carrier gases, in its several forms (gas-phase flow, water displacement by gas, gas slugs and bubbles) seems to represent a major migration process. Accordingly, in contrast with early views, the role of gas diffusion and water advection in the transport of endogenous gas to the Earth surface should be strongly minimized in many contexts. In a wide range of geological settings, carrier gases (CO2, CH4) may assume a dominant role in controlling transport and redistribution toward the Earth's surface of trace gases (Rn, He). Bubble movement in fissured rocks seems to be an effective way of rapid (gas velocities in the order of 100 to 103 m per day) and long-distance gas migration. The evolution from bubble regimes to continuous phase flow and vice versa, as gas pressure and fracture width change, is the most suitable mechanism towards determining the surface geochemical processes of seismo-tectonic, environmental and geo-exploration relevance. The transport effectiveness of trace gases by a carrier gas has yet to be studied in quantitative terms. It is already clear, however, that further studies on the distribution and behavior of trace gases approaching the Earth's surface may not be meaningful unless accompanied by carrier gas dynamics analyses. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Radon ((222)Rn) is a naturally occurring chemically inert, colorless, and odorless radioactive gas produced from the decay of uranium ((238)U), which is ubiquitous in rocks and soils worldwide. Exposure to (222)Rn is likely the second leading cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking via inhalation; however, exposure through untreated groundwater is also a contributing factor to both inhalation and ingestion routes. A land use regression (LUR) model for groundwater (222)Rn with anisotropic geological and (238)U based explanatory variables is developed, which helps elucidate the factors contributing to elevated (222)Rn across North Carolina. The LUR is also integrated into the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) geostatistical framework to increase accuracy and produce a point-level LUR-BME model of groundwater (222)Rn across North Carolina including prediction uncertainty. The LUR-BME model of groundwater (222)Rn results in a leave-one out cross-validation r(2) of 0.46 (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.68), effectively predicting within the spatial covariance range. Modeled results of (222)Rn concentrations show variability among intrusive felsic geological formations likely due to average bedrock (238)U defined on the basis of overlying stream-sediment (238)U concentrations that is a widely distributed consistently analyzed point-source data.},

abstract = {Small-scale spatial and temporal distribution of soil CO2 within the natural CO2 spring (mofette) field Stave{\v{s}}inci (NE Slovenia) was studied. By using an infrared gas-analyser, gas measurements were performed measuring soil CO2 in a regular sampling grid (depth 20 cm, resolution 0.5 m) in an area of 60 m2. The measurements were performed at different times of the year, in May (20) 2002 and in November (10 and 17) and December (4) 2003. To illustrate the small-scale spatial variability of soil CO2 concentration, the data were interpolated by the inverse distance third power moving average method. The main geothermal exhalation spots were marked and the gaseous environment of different parts of the mofette area was described. One third of the plot was strongly enriched in CO2 with median CO2 concentration ranging from 21.3{\%} to 30.9{\%} in four samplings. The measurements revealed a clear patchy pattern of soil CO2 enrichment. Drastic changes of soil CO2 concentrations over a short distance indicate limited lateral diffusion in the silty-clay mofette soil. The spatial patterns of soil gases can be regarded as fairly constant over longer periods of time as revealed by a comparison of consecutive samplings. The growth of Solidago gigantea in the studied area was followed and clear negative correlations have been proved when plant height and leaf chlorophyll content were compared to soil CO2 concentration. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient for average plant height and average soil [CO2] was r = - 0.69, and for leaf chlorophyll content and soil [CO2] was r = - 0.76. Our study showed that the relation between the gaseous environment and plant response at the natural CO2 springs could be efficiently explained on the basis of soil [CO2]. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Since April 2004, preparatory work prior to CO2 injection has been conducted in the CO2SINK Project, the European Union's first research and development activity on the in-situ testing of geological storage of CO2 near the town of Ketzin, Germany. Carbon dioxide will be injected into a saline aquifer of the Triassic Stuttgart Formation in an anticlinal structure of the northeast German Basin. The drilling of one injection and two observation wells will commence at the end of 2006. The predrilling phase focuses on the baseline geological parameters of the anticline. The Stuttgart Formation is lithologically heterogeneous; it consists of sandy channel-(string)-facies rocks, with good reservoir properties alternating with muddy flood-plain-facies rocks of poor reservoir quality. Playa-type rocks form the immediate cap rock above the CO2SINK reservoir. A geostatistical approach has been applied to describe the reservoir architecture between and beyond well control. This model forms the basis for the generation of reservoir-dynamic models of CO2 injection that assist in the planning of injection operations and in the understanding of CO2 plume evolution. A verification of the geometry of the reservoir and the structural situation of its overburden is expected from a three-dimensional baseline seismic survey that was conducted in the autumn of 2005. Laboratory experiments under simulated in-situ conditions were performed to evaluate the geophysical signature of rocks saturated with CO2. The chemical composition of the groundwater and the CO2 flux in the soil were analyzed across the Ketzin anticline, providing the baseline for a monitoring program during and after injection of CO2, targeted at the detection of potential CO2 leakage from the storage reservoir.},

abstract = {Objectives Previous studies on firefighters indicate an increased risk of cancer although findings regarding which cancer sites are in excess have been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to investigate the cancer incidence among Swedish firefighters. Methods This updated cohort study included 1080 men who worked at least 1 year as a firefighter in the city of Stockholm, Sweden during 1931–1983. First-time diagnoses of cancer were identified through the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1958 until 2012. Employment as a firefighter was determined from the annual fire station enrolment records. Standardized inci- dence ratios were calculated using the Stockholm population as reference. Results Firefighters in Stockholm had a low overall risk of cancer (SIR = 0.81 95{\%} CI 0.71–0.91). However, firefighters were at an increased risk of stomach cancer (SIR = 1.89 95{\%} CI 1.25–2.75). Firefighters had significantly low risks for prostate cancer (SIR = 0.68 95{\%} CI 0.52–0.87) and malignant melanoma of the skin (SIR = 0.30 95{\%} CI 0.06–0.88). There was a statistically significant trend of increasing overall risk of cancer with increasing employment duration, although there was still no excess of cancer overall in any of the categories of employment duration. Conclusion Stockholm firefighters had an increased risk of stomach cancer but a low overall risk of cancer. The trend of increasing overall risk of cancer with increasing employment duration could potentially be related to the carcinogenic exposures at work},

abstract = {We present a comparative study of soil CO2 flux (F-CO2) measured by five groups (Groups 1-5) at the IAVCEI-CCVG Eighth Workshop on Volcanic Gases on Masaya volcano, Nicaragua. Groups 1-5 measured F-CO2 using the accumulation chamber method at 5-m spacing within a 900 m{\textless}Superscript{\textgreater}2supercript stop grid during a morning (AM) period. These measurements were repeated by Groups 1-3 during an afternoon (PM) period. Measured F-CO2 ranged from 218 to 14,719 g m(-2) day(-1). The variability of the five measurements made at each grid point ranged from +/- 5 to 167{\%}. However, the arithmetic means of fluxes measured over the entire grid and associated total CO2 emission rate estimates varied between groups by only +/- 22{\%}. All three groups that made PM measurements reported an 8-19{\%} increase in total emissions over the AM results. Based on a comparison of measurements made during AM and PM times, we argue that this change is due in large part to natural temporal variability of gas flow, rather than to measurement error. In order to estimate the mean and associated CO2 emission rate of one data set and to map the spatial F-CO2 distribution, we compared six geostatistical methods: arithmetic and minimum variance unbiased estimator means of uninterpolated data, and arithmetic means of data interpolated by the multiquadric radial basis function, ordinary kriging, multi-Gaussian kriging, and sequential Gaussian simulation methods. While the total CO2 emission rates estimated using the different techniques only varied by +/- 4.4{\%}, the F-CO2 maps showed important differences. We suggest that the sequential Gaussian simulation method yields the most realistic representation of the spatial distribution of F-CO2, but a variety of geostatistical methods are appropriate to estimate the total CO2 emission rate from a study area, which is a primary goal in volcano monitoring research.},

abstract = {Compositional data are very common in the earth sciences. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to the spatial interpolation of these data sets. Most interpolators do not necessarily satisfy the constant sum and nonnegativity constraints of compositional data, nor take spatial structure into account. Therefore, compositional kriging is introduced as a straightforward extension of ordinary kriging that complies with these constraints. In two case studies, the performance of compositional kriging is compared with that of the additive logratio-transform. In the first case study, compositional kriging yielded significantly more accurate predictions than the additive logratio-transform, while in the second ease study the performances were comparable.},

abstract = {This paper describes results from the first field experiment designed to evaluate a new approach for quantifying gaseous fugitive emissions of area air pollution sources. The approach combines path-integrated concentration data acquired with any path-integrated optical remote sensing (PI-ORS) technique and computed tomography (CT) technique. In this study, an open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) instrument sampled path-integrated concentrations along five radial beam paths in a vertical plane downwind from the source. A meteorological station collected measurements of wind direction and wind speed. Nitrous oxide (N2O) was released from a controlled area source simulator. The innovative CT technique, which applies the smooth basis function minimization method to the beam data in conjunction with measured wind data, was used to estimate the total flux from the simulated area source. The new approach estimates consistently underestimated the true emission rates in unstable atmospheric conditions and agreed with the true emission rate in neutral atmospheric conditions. This approach is applicable to many types of industrial areas or volume sources, given the use of an adequate PI-ORS system.},

abstract = {It is well known that skin sea surface temperature (SSST) is different from bulk sea surface temperature (BSST) by a few tenths of a degree Celsius. However, the extent of the error associated with dry deposition (or uptake) estimation by using BSST is not well known. This study tries to conduct such an evaluation using the on-board observation data over the South China Sea in the summers of 2004 and 2006. It was found that when a warm layer occurred, the deposition velocities using BSST were underestimated within the range of 0.8-4.3{\%}, and the absorbed sea surface heat flux was overestimated by 21 W m-2. In contrast, under cool skin only conditions, the deposition velocities using BSST were overestimated within the range of 0.5-2.0{\%}, varying with pollutants and the absorbed sea surface heat flux was underestimated also by 21 W m-2. Scale analysis shows that for a slightly soluble gas (e.g., NO2, NO and CO), the error in the solubility estimation using BSST is the major source of the error in dry deposition estimation. For a highly soluble gas (e.g., SO2), the error in the estimation of turbulent heat fluxes and, consequently, aerodynamic resistance and gas-phase film resistance using BSST is the major source of the total error. In contrast, for a medium soluble gas (e.g., O3 and CO2) both the errors from the estimations of the solubility and aerodynamic resistance are important. In addition, deposition estimations using various assumptions are discussed. The largest uncertainty is from the parameterizations for chemical enhancement factors. Other important areas of uncertainty include: (1) various parameterizations for gas-transfer velocity; (2) neutral-atmosphere assumption; (3) using BSST as SST, and (4) constant pH value assumption. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Escola de Minas. All rights reserved. Estimation of some mineral deposits involves chemical species or a granulometric mass balance that constitute a closed constant sum (e.g., 100{\%}). Data that add up to a constant are known as compositional data (CODA). Classical geostatistical estimation methods (e.g., kriging) are not satisfactory when CODA are used, since bias is expected when estimated mean block values are back-transformed to the original space. CODA methods use nonlinear transformations, and when the transformed data are interpolated, they cannot be returned directly to the space of the original data. If these averages are back-transformed using the inverse function, bias is generated. To avoid this bias, this article proposes geostatistical simulation of the isometric logratio ratio (ilr) transformations back-transforming point simulated values (instead of block estimations), with the averaging being postponed to the end of the process. The results show that, in addition to maintaining the mass balance and the correlations among the variables, the means (E-types) of the simulations satisfactorily reproduce the statistical characteristics of the grades without any sort of bias. A complete case study of a major bauxite deposit illustrates the methodology.},

abstract = {The ??skjuvatn caldera at Askja volcano, North Iceland, was formed as a result of an explosive eruption at Askja on 28th-29th March 1875. ??skjuvatn is one of the youngest collapse calderas on Earth, and its initiation and growth were observed and documented by explorers and geologists working in the Askja region between 1875 and 1932. It is an example of caldera formation where the volume of the caldera collapse far exceeds the volume of associated erupted products. The discrepancy between the collapse volume and associated erupted products has been used by previous workers as a justification for the hypothesis that the injection of lateral dykes from Askja fed the February to October 1875 N??jahraun fissure eruptions at the Sveinagj?? graben, some 60. km north of Askja. However, historical accounts documenting the caldera formation in sufficient detail show clearly that ??skjuvatn formed by piecemeal collapse, taking over 40. years to reach its current form. We use these accounts to undertake a detailed examination of the stages of caldera collapse and to compare them with the known magmatic output of Askja in the years following the 1875 eruption. ArcGIS software was used to calculate the volume of ??skjuvatn during the various stages of collapse, and the volume of material erupted after 1875. While a dyke extending between Askja and Sveinagj?? may be implied to account for the 'missing' volume, our results demonstrate that the volume of ??skjuvatn in July 1875 closely corresponds to the volume of rhyolitic material erupted on 28th-29th March 1875. In addition, geochemical evidence indicates that the N??jahraun magmas were sourced from a deeper reservoir rather than by lateral injection from Askja's shallow crustal magma chamber. We therefore suggest that the injection of sills and dykes in a coherent intrusion complex beneath Askja central volcano, combined with background deflation of the magma storage zone beneath ??skjuvatn caldera over 30 to 40. years following 1875, satisfactorily accommodates the volume required to form ??skjuvatn caldera. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Radon is the second risk factor for lung cancer after tobacco consumption and therefore it is necessary to know the burden of disease due to its exposure. The objective of this study is to estimate radon-attributable lung cancer mortality in Galicia, a high emission area located at the Northwest Spain. Methods: A prevalence-based attribution method was applied. Prevalence of tobacco use and radon exposure were obtained from a previously published study of the same area. Attributable mortality was calculated for each of six possible risk categories, based on radon exposure and smoking status. Two scenarios were used, with 37 Bq/m3 and 148 Bq/m3 as the respective radon exposure thresholds. As the observed mortality we used lung cancer mortality for 2001 from the Galician mortality registry. Results: Mortality exclusively attributable to radon exposure ranged from 3{\%} to 5{\%} for both exposure thresholds, respectively. Attributable mortality to combined exposure to radon and smoking stood at around 22{\%} for exposures above 148 Bq/m3. Applying the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action level, radon has a role in 25{\%} of all lung cancers. Conclusions: Although the estimates have been derived from a study with a relatively limited sample size, these results highlight the importance of radon exposure as a cause of lung cancer and its effect in terms of disease burden. Radon mitigation activities in the study area must therefore be enforced.},

The physics of this flow is essentially a multiphase multicomponent phenomenon in a strongly heterogeneous medium necessitating the need for a computationally prohibitive resolution to capture the various physical processes at all scales. Upscaling is an important step in these simulations when going from geostatistical models featuring strong heterogeneities to the simulation models which in practice are limited because of computational restrictions. Although many different upscaling techniques exist, including dynamic and steady-state methods, thorough analyses of their application to CO2 sequestration are not yet established. This review aims to highlight the recent developments in the application of upscaling to the modeling of long-term CO2 storage and provide insights into aspects that could prove valuable to numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Chemical tracers have been used in various C capture and storage (CCS) projects worldwide primarily to provide information regarding subsurface migration of CO2 and to verify CO2 containment. Understanding the movement and interactions of CO2 in the subsurface is a challenging task considering the variety of states in which it exists (i.e. gas, liquid, supercritical, dissolved in water) and the range of possible storage mechanisms (i.e. residual or capillary trapping, dissolved in water, structural trapping or incorporation into minerals). This paper critically reviews several chemical tracer applications and case studies for CCS projects. In many instances, there are parallels (e.g. tracer classes and applications) between tracers in the oil and gas industry and in CCS. It has been shown that chemical tracers can complement geophysical measurements (e.g. seismic) in understanding the formation behaviour of CO2. Although tracers have been successfully used in many CCS projects, some fundamental information, for example partitioning and adsorption, about the behaviour of tracers is still lacking and this can be an issue when interpreting tracer data (e.g. determining leakage rates). In this paper the deployment and recovery of chemical tracers and their use on various CCS projects are described. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {A 3D coupled biogeochemical-hydrodynamic model (MIRO-CO2{\&}CO) is implemented in the English Channel (ECH) and the Southern Bight of the North Sea (SBNS) to estimate the present-day spatio-temporal distribution of air-sea CO2 fluxes, surface water partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and other components of the carbonate system (pH, saturation state of calcite (??ca) and of aragonite (??ar)), and the main drivers of their variability. Over the 1994-2004 period, air-sea CO2 fluxes show significant inter-annual variability, with oscillations between net annual CO2 sinks and sources. The inter-annual variability of air-sea CO2 fluxes simulated in the SBNS is controlled primarily by river loads and changes of biological activities (net autotrophy in spring and early summer, and net heterotrophy in winter and autumn), while in areas less influenced by river inputs such as the ECH, the inter-annual variations of air-sea CO2 fluxes are mainly due to changes in sea surface temperature and in near-surface wind strength and direction. In the ECH, the decrease of pH, of ??ca and of ??ar follows the one expected from the increase of atmospheric CO2 (ocean acidification), but the decrease of these quantities in the SBNS during the considered time period is faster than the one expected from ocean acidification alone. This seems to be related to a general pattern of decreasing nutrient river loads and net ecosystem production (NEP) in the SBNS. Annually, the combined effect of carbon and nutrient loads leads to an increase of the sink of CO2 in the ECH and the SBNS, but the impact of the river loads varies spatially and is stronger in river plumes and nearshore waters than in offshore waters. The impact of organic and inorganic carbon (C) inputs is mainly confined to the coast and generates a source of CO2 to the atmosphere and low pH, of ??ca and of ??ar values in estuarine plumes, while the impact of nutrient loads, highest than the effect of C inputs in coastal nearshore waters, also propagates offshore and, by stimulating primary production, drives a sink of atmospheric CO2 and higher values of pH, of ??ca and of ??ar. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Urban areas generate distinctive climates that are revealed in the statistics of wind, temperature, humidity and so on. These properties are the result of energy exchanges between the atmosphere and underlying urban surface, which is the focus of physical climatology studies. These exchanges form an energy budget (EB), which includes radiation exchanges (both solar and terrestrial), the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat and the energy transferred to the substrate by conduction. An evaluation of these exchanges and their spatial variation is essential to explaining the effect that cities have on climate at all scales. However, observing these exchanges is difficult and requires both sensitive equipment and careful placement to ensure representative readings. This paper presents some initial results on the EB over two urban surfaces in Dublin, one a densely built urban site near the city centre and the other a mature, well-vegetated, suburban site. The results demonstrate the effects of different urban surface features on surface-air exchanges. The objective hysteresis model is also employed to evaluate the energy balance residual. Results show good agreement between modelled and residual values. Although there have been studies on Dublin's urban climate, most notably its urban heat island (UHI), there has been no prior study of the energetic processes responsible for this local climate change. This research programme, for which initial results are presented in this paper, is one of the few studies globally that will maintain long-term measurements (five years) of urban EBs.},

Following several episodes of dangerous CO2 exhalation from soils during the last 20 years and earlier as historically recorded, the work aimed at assessing the Natural Gas Hazard (NGH) including the indoor-Rn hazard. The NGH was defined as the probability of an area to become a site of poisonous peri-volcanic gas exhalations from soils to the lower atmosphere (comprising buildings). CO2 was found to be a "carrier" for the other poisonous minor and in trace components (H2S, CH4, Rn-222, etc.). This assessment was performed by extrapolating in the aquifer CO2 and Rn-222 conditions, and discriminating sectors where future CO2 flux in soils as well as indoor-Rn measurements have to be noted. A preliminary indoor-Rn survey was performed at about 200 sites. The highest values were found in the highest pCO(2) and high Rn-222 values in groundwater. This indicates convection and enhanced permeability in certain sectors of the main aquifer, i.e., along the bordering faults and inside the gas-trap of the Ciampino Horst., where "continuous gas-phase micro-macro seepage mechanism" is invoked to explain the high peri-volcanic gases flux.},

abstract = {Injection of CO2 into the Weyburn Oil Field, Saskatchewan, Canada, began October 2000 and 10 years later approximately 18 MT of CO 2 will have been stored in the geological reservoir. The CO 2 injection is part of an ongoing enhanced oil recovery effort that will extend to 2035 and likely beyond. Both Weyburn and the adjacent Midale oil field are highly suitable for CO2-EOR and it is expected that, combined, more than 40 MT CO2 will eventually be stored in these carbonate reservoirs. Currently about 2.4 MT and 0.4 MT CO2/year are being stored in the Weyburn and Midale fields, respectively, which now represent the largest site of monitored geological storage of CO2 globally. The Weyburn Field is operated by Cenovus Energy and the Midale Field by Apache Canada. The anthropogenic CO2 used at Weyburn-Midale is a by-product of coal gasification at the Great Plains Synfuels Plant in North Dakota, USA. The compressed CO2 is delivered to the oil fields through a 323 km pipeline that crosses the international boundary. The IEA GHG Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project was established prior to the onset of CO2 injection at Weyburn to assess monitoring methods and subsurface processes associated with the injection of CO2 into geological storage sites. This research program is now in its second phase of research. Baseline 3D seismic surveys were performed over the Weyburn Field before injection and subsequent repeat 3D seismic surveys have been taken during the course of injection spanning multiple years and have indicated that CO 2 distribution within the reservoir can be imaged seismically. Similarly, repeat reservoir fluid sampling surveys have monitored a range of chemical and isotopic parameters to help identify processes associated with CO2-rock interaction. In addition, multiple soil gas and shallow hydrology surveys have been performed during the past 10 years with no indication of CO2 reaching the surface. The current research program is building on many of the results obtained during the first phase of work on the Weyburn Field. For example, some of the current research includes applying stochastic methods to relate fluid chemistry to the seismic data to better characterize the distribution of CO2 in the subsurface. Additional methods of modeling CO2 distribution post-injection are also being demonstrated and integrated into several risk assessment methodologies. A detailed well database has been developed to catalogue characteristics associated with wells drilled at various stages of field development using different cementing practices and completion methods to assist with providing parameters for long-term modeling of well behaviour. In addition, a downhole well integrity testing program to examine cement sheath characteristics will be implemented in two wells in each of the fields. In summary, more than 30 research studies are being performed within this phase of the program to examine aspects of site characterization, well integrity, geochemical and geophysical monitoring methods and risk assessment. One of the goals for the work from this research program is to provide a best practices manual for the transition of CO2-EOR sites into storage sites. This paper provides an overview of the studies and results developing from the research program. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to bring the technology towards reduced costs and to make CCS an economically viable mitigation option, the European Commission created a comprehensive demonstration programme aimed to encourage development and accelerate commercial CCS deployment. The goal was to have up to 12 CCS demonstration projects by 2015.This is far away from reality today. Despite the tremendous effort, the two major European CCS funds - the European Energy Programme for Recovery and more recently the New Entrants Reserve of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme Programme (NER300) - are struggling to secure a single demonstration project to move forward.Originally intended as a CCS instrument, the NER300 first round published on November 2010 has been followed with great expectation by CCS community. However, in December 2012 the Commission announced that not one CCS project was awarded.This paper reviews the NER300 process, analyses the reasons for the programme's lack of success in securing CCS demonstration projects, and distills the lessons learnt. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Aliaǧa metal industry district located 50 km northwest of Izmir City, in Turkey, includes many metal factories. The geology of the area is represented by Mesozoic flysch deposits and Cenozoic volcano sedimentary rocks. Tectonic elements are NE - SW and NW - Se trending faults and a W - NW trending fault direction that is important for water supply. Rock, soil, stream sediment, and water samples taken at various distances from the industrial area were analyzed for Fe, Ti, Mn, Cr, Pb, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Mo. According to the results, the elements in rocks are reasonable for the range of "Clarke" values, but in the soils and stream sediment, they comprise higher values than are acceptable for agricultural activities. Toxicity analyses were carried out in the drinking artesian water of {\c{C}}akmakli village and wastewater samples of the factories and river water both of which are used for irrigation of the agricultural areas in and around the investigated area. The people should, however be made aware that this waste and river water is unacceptable for agriculture. Additionally, the contamination of seawater in Nemrut Bay is probably caused by contaminated river and underground water running to the sea. The chemical and toxicity analysis of drinking water samples show that they are above accepted standards and harmful. Previous air pollution studies (funnel gas emission analyses) also show that gas emission contains high amount of dust particles with high Fe, Zn, Pb, and Cu concentrations. As a result, all elements analyzed are of great importance relative to problems concerning contamination of the soil, stream sediment, ground surface water, and air by individual metals from uncontrolled processing of some metal factories. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

After more than one year of continuous measurements, some spike-like anomalous high radon and thoron concentrations could be observed. A similar soil radon spectrum was also obtained from an independent monitoring station, which was only 100 m away. These anomalous peaks usually occurred a few days or weeks before the earthquakes (ML≥4.5).

abstract = {Spatial statistical analysis of georeferenced data of total cadmium (TCd) in forest soils of Sweden was assumed to provide more advantageous maps than traditional interpolated maps. However, 264 measurements of TCd in O-horizon of forest soils displayed skewed frequency distribution. Since atypical observations affect badly the variogram, outliers were identified, different data transformations were tested and ordinary (OK) and lognormal kriging (LK) scenarios were compared based on cross-validation. Results were compared using overall measures of predictors, e.g. traditional mean squared prediction error (MSPE), mean of kriging variances, variance ratio, median of internally standardised residuals, and assessments of classification accuracy, such as percentage of correctly predicted samples and within-class MSPE. One outlier was identified based on the absolute value of skewness of value differences less or equal to one in data pairs separated at certain lag classes. Mapping categories characterised by percentage of correct classification and within-class MSPE were found to be essential in comparison of kriging results additionally to the overall measures. In comparison of kriging methods, OK predicted high values more accurately and LK was more effective to predict low and medium values. Thus, OK was suggested for mapping high concentration of TCd and other pollutants. Percentage of correctly predicted samples and within-class MSPE were found to be dependent on kriging method, as well as on the number and limits of categories.},

abstract = {We report (quasi) periodic oscillations observed in soil radon emanation data especially during summer period. Soil radon has been continuously monitored in the Marmara region of Turkey over the past nine years to reveal possible relationships between soil radon and seismic activities. This long term monitoring has clearly demonstrated that soil radon concentrations are affected by various parameters such as seasonal and daily changes in atmospheric parameters (temperature, pressure, precipitation). Sometimes, soil temperature variations as well as barometric pressure and precipitation may dominantly influence the soil radon concentration; leading to seemingly complex radon time series. One may need to remove such components for better analysis of the possible relationships between soil radon emanation and seismic activities. Here, we suggest using an algorithm to detect and remove daily-oscillations from the raw data. The detection and separation (extraction) algorithm is based on Empirical Mode Decomposition method which is a signal-adaptive method that automatically decompose the signal into its characteristic modes. The algorithm is applied to the data collected from three different soil radon monitoring stations (Balikesir, G{\"{o}}nen, and Armutlu) in Marmara region of Turkey and the results are provided. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

                        2S and Rn. These advective features are generated by fluid leakage from buried reservoirs hosted in the structural highs of the Mesozoic carbonate basement. Gas migration towards the surface is controlled by fault and fracture systems bordering the structural highs of the carbonate formations (e.g. Ciampino high). His release is triggered when the total pressure of the fluid phase exceeds the hydrostatic pressure, thus forming a free gas phase. Furthermore, both the sudden and catastrophic, and slow and continuous gas release at surface, of naturally occurring toxic species (CO
                        2, H
                        2S and Rn) poses a serious health risk to people living in this geologically active area. This paper presents data obtained from soil gas and gas flux surveys, as well as gas isotopes analyses, which suggest the presence of a deep origin gas flux enriched in carbon dioxide and minor species (CH
                        4 and H

abstract = {Situated within the Jordan Rift Valley, along the shores of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) which serves as the national water reservoir of Israel, are saline hot springs that are notable for their enrichment in radon and radium. Though the anomalous radioactivity has been known for almost half a century, the source of the radioactive anomalies has been a subject of conjecture. Radiometric analysis of a rock core drilled through Mt. Arbel, situated to the west of the lake, reveals that the oil shale sequence of the Senonian En Zetim and Ghareb formations is strikingly deficient in radium. Mt. Arbel has been cut by Rift Valley related faults that serve as conduits for ascending brines. The organic matter enriched sequence is encountered in the subsurface at elevations lower than the water level of the nearby radioactive enriched hot springs. It is thus concluded that hot ascending brines underlying the lake flush through the organic matter enriched sequence and remove a substantial percentage of 226Ra from the uranium enriched organic material, before draining to the outlets of the springs. Saline springs that are in contact with organic matter enriched sequence show excess of radium and radon, while fresh water springs in the same stratigraphic position show only excess of radon.},

abstract = {The In Salah project in Algeria is an industrial-scale CO2 storage project in operation since 2004. Carbon dioxide from several gas fields with a CO2 content of 1-10{\%} is removed from the production stream to meet the export specification of 0.3{\%} CO2. It is re-injected it into a 20m thick fractured sandstone formation down-dip of the Krechba producing field at a depth of around 1850m. There are currently three horizontal injectors at Krechba, injecting up to 50mmscfd of CO2 and drilled perpendicular to the dominant fracture orientation to maximize injection capacity. Over the life of the project it is planned to store up to 17 million tonnes of CO2 - to date, just over 3 million tonnes of CO2 have been injected. A Joint Industry Project (JIP) was set up in 2005 to monitor the CO2 storage process using a variety of geochemical, geophysical and production techniques over a 5 year period. A pre-injection risk register was prepared as part of the initial assessment of the injection site which was used to design the original monitoring programme. Key risks identified included leakage from old wellbores and possible vertical leakage through the overburden. Four years after injection start up, a quantitative risk assessment was undertaken which identified wellbore integrity and potential migration of CO2 out of the licensed storage area as the key risks which resulted in further changes to the forward monitoring programme. A data collection programme was initiated prior to the start of injection in August 2004. A number of monitoring technology reviews have been conducted over the last 5 years using detailed modeling and a Boston Square which has been invaluable in comparing the relative cost and value of quite diverse technologies. To date, with the exception of the CO2 encountered in the old KB-5 appraisal well (now fully decommissioned), there has been no indication of any CO 2 moving out of the storage complex (comprising the injection zone and the immediate overburden). The suite of technologies to be deployed at any CO2 storage site for monitoring and verification purposes is readily available and uses mainly standard oilfield techniques and practices. However, each site will require a site specific suite of cost effective and focused technologies to provide the maximum benefit - there is no 'cookie cutter' approach when it comes to designing a Monitoring and Verification programme. Our experience at Krechba to date is only in the early phases of a programme which could extend for 20 years and our key conclusions from the first 5 years of monitoring will be presented. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In well-structured topsoils, part of the soil organic matter (SOM) is located in the interior of the soil aggregates. Because of its location, this part of the SOM is little accessible to micro-organisms, and consequently not readily mineralised. Additionally, the physico-chemical conditions on the aggregate surfaces, being the main habitat of the organisms, control the accessibility, and hence, the rate of mineralisation. We hypothesise that hydrophobic conditions on aggregate surfaces reduce the rate of mineralisation of inside SOM, and simultaneously enhance the aggregate stability. The objectives of this study were therefore to study the significance of soil wettability with respect to both SOM mineralisation and aggregate stability. We used soil material from a loess-derived Gleyic Luvisol, either used as cropland or as grassland. Wettability was measured in terms of both the advancing soil-water contact angle and the solid surface free energy. Aggregate stability was assessed by immersion of aggregates in water-ethanol mixtures of varying surface tension. The impact of aggregation on SOM mineralisation was determined by respiration experiments that measured the CO2-release both from the aggregates and from the corresponding homogenised soil material. It was found that the contact angle of the soil samples ranged from 17??to 79??, and the solid surface free energy from 34 to 68 mJ m-2. Aggregates showed increasing stability with decreasing surface tension of the testing liquid. With increasing contact angle, the initial aggregate breakdown was decreased, which we attribute to the wettability-dependence of the liquid adsorption rates of the aggregates. Soil respiration measurements showed that microbial SOM decomposition was affected by the aggregation status, i.e., the homogenised samples released significantly more CO2 than the aggregates. We conclude that even subcritical soil water repellency (with contact angles {\textless}90??) can have a significant impact on the protection of SOM against microbial decomposition. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The main role of INERIS (French National Institute for Industrial Environment and Risks) is to assess and avert accidental and chronic risks to both people and the environment linked to industrial installations, chemical substances and underground operations. INERIS is thus involved in research consortiums for underground storages of wastes, hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide. Concerning carbon dioxide storage, INERIS works for many years on defining and testing monitoring methods. As a French expert, the institute also performs integrated risk assessment studies. This paper focuses on the last improvements concerning the monitoring methods developed or patented by INERIS. Because the institute was created from the research centre of the former French national coal mining company, it has a wellestablished know-how in monitoring gas atmospheres. Having developed monitoring methods for mining contexts, INERIS has tools to constrain gas migrations in subsurface: 1. to determine gas flux between soil and atmosphere with dynamic accumulation chambers; 2. to determine gas concentrations in unsaturated zones through integrated gas sensor systems linked to subsurface boreholes (from 0 to about 300 meters depth). Initially designed for mining context, these two methods have been tested and proven for the monitoring of CO2 geological storage contexts. For example between 2005 and 2007, INERIS was one of the five partners involved in the "GeoCarbone MONITORING" research project. This project was funded by the French Research Agency and aims at defining methods to monitor CO 2 storage sites. Today the institute is involved in other projects studying pilot sites. In this paper we present results collected in analog contexts to CO2 storage sites. We will discuss in which conditions the carbon isotopic signature ??13C can help to determine the possible origins of the gas analyzed in our devices and to better understand the physical and chemical processes which can have led to the studied gas compositions. We will also highlight the fact that in some cases, there is a real need of using isotopic tracing methods otherwise the identification of these different processes cannot be done easily. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

An attempt is made to standardise the terminology currently in use and to distinguish clearly between ambient temperature deposits (tufas), thermal deposits (travertines) and speleothems. Consideration is also presented of the physico-chemical and biological processes, often acting together, which are responsible for the precipitation of freshwater calcium carbonate within tufa systems. These processes appear to be climatically controlled. Therefore, tufas may be of value in palaeo-environmental reconstruction, especially if intercalated with peaty material. While the majority of tufa deposits are of post-glacial age some of the most spectacular carbonate precipitates are thermal travertines. The second part of the paper deals with a world-wide survey of the principal deposits of tufa and travertine. Space prevents a fuller account of the European deposits and the reader is preferred to Pentecost (1995) for a wide range of specific examples from Europe and Asia Minor.},

abstract = {High concentrations of radon are often used as a geophysical tool for uranium exploration, earthquake and volcanic activity predication, and fault zones confirmation. The aim of this study was to assure the suitability of this method in the study of fault zones. For this purpose, a portable AlphaGUARD PQ 2000 device was used to detect the fracture zones along Qena-Safaga road, Eastern Desert, Egypt. Radon soil gas anomalies were found to be linearly distributed along NW-SE and NE-SW trends. Such directions agree well with the directions of the active fault deduced from earlier studies. Radon concentration in soil along the repeated three profiles was anomalously high in all fault zones by a factor of 3-6 above background values. In the profiles studied, the peaks recorded on the fault trace were found to be higher than the background. The analysis of the water samples collected from a well in the studied area showed that the HCO3 contents exceeded 1000 ppm, providing an additional evidence that the area under study is likely to be included within a major seismic belt. This study confirms strongly that radon gas and hydrochemical studies are a good tool for fault zones detection in similar areas. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Soil CO2 fluxes were measured, from November 1998 to October 2000, over non-irrigated barley in Central Spain using a gas-exchange soil chamber, and covering a 10 cm soil temperature range of 1-29??C. Soil CO 2 fluxes exhibited seasonal variation with an increase from March to October, peaking in May, and a decrease of around a factor of 2 during the winter. The mean of the data recorded during 53 days and covering all the seasons of the year was 2.0 ??mol m-2 s-1, and the extreme values ranged from 0.2 to 8.0 ??mol m-2 s-1. During the sampling campaign, 10 cm soil temperature measurements were also conducted and NDVI data were calculated by means of NOAA satellite images as 10-day maximum composite values. With these data, two different empirical equations were fitted for soil CO2 predictions. Both were dependent on a second order 10 cm soil temperature but differed in the way they considered a surrogate of soil water content and plant vitality as second input data. The first equation roughly took into account the influence of soil water content by sorting out the whole days in two clusters, those corresponding to rainfall occurrences on the measuring day or on the day before measurement and the remaining ones. The second was on NDVI. The squared correlation coefficient of each empirical equation was 71{\%} and 74{\%}, respectively. The maximum fluxes were reached at a 10 cm soil temperature of 17??C. The relationship with soil temperature indicated that the flux should be negligible below 3??C and above 31??C. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) following aqua regia digestion and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) are both geochemical techniques used to determine ‘total' concentrations of elements in soil. The aim of this study is to compare these techniques, identify elements for which inconsistencies occur and investigate why they arise. A study area (∼14,000 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) with a variety of total concentration controls and a large geochemical dataset (n = 7950) was selected. Principal component analysis determined underlying variance in a dataset composed of both geogenic and anthropogenic elements. Where inconsistencies between the techniques were identified, further numerical and spatial analysis was completed. The techniques are more consistent for elements of geogenic sources and lead, whereas other elements of anthropogenic sources show less consistency within rural samples. XRF is affected by sample matrix, while the form of element affects ICP concentrations. Depending on their use in environmental studies, different outcomes would be expected from the techniques employed, suggesting the choice of analytical technique for geochemical analyses may be more critical than realised.},

abstract = {The atmospheric methane budget is commonly defined assuming that major sources derive from the biosphere (wetlands, rice paddies, animals, termites) and that fossil, radiocarbon-free CH4 emission is due to and mediated by anthropogenic activity (natural gas production and distribution, and coal mining). However, the amount of radiocarbon-free CH4 in the atmosphere, estimated at approximately 20{\%} of atmospheric CH4, is higher than the estimates from statistical data of CH4 emission from fossil fuel related anthropogenic sources. This work documents that significant amounts of "old" methane, produced within the Earth crust, can be released naturally into the atmosphere through gas permeable faults and fractured rocks. Major geologic emissions of methane are related to hydrocarbon production in sedimentary basins (biogenic and thermogenic methane) and, subordinately, to inorganic reactions (Fischer-Tropsch type) in geothermal systems. Geologic CH4 emissions include diffuse fluxes over wide areas, or microseepage, on the order of 100-102 mgm-2 day-1, and localised flows and gas vents, on the order of 102 t y-1, both on land and on the seafloor. Mud volcanoes producing flows of up to 103 t y-1 represent the largest visible expression of geologic methane emission. Several studies have indicated that methanotrophic consumption in soil may be insufficient to consume all leaking geologic CH4 and positive fluxes into the atmosphere can take place in dry or seasonally cold environments. Unsaturated soils have generally been considered a major sink for atmospheric methane, and never a continuous, intermittent, or localised source to the atmosphere. Although geologic CH4 sources need to be quantified more accurately, a preliminary global estimate indicates that there are likely more than enough sources to provide the amount of methane required to account for the suspected missing source of fossil CH4. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {We provide background information to allow a heuristic understanding of two types of criteria used in selecting a model for making inferences from ringing data. The first type of criteria (e.g. AIC, AlCc QAICc and TIC) are estimates of (relative) Kullback-Leibler information or distance and attempt to select a good approximating model for inference, based on the principle of parsimony. The second type of criteria (e.g. BIC, MDL, HQ) are 'dimension consistent' in that they attempt to consistently estimate the dimension of the true model. These latter criteria assume that a true model exists, that it is in the set of candidate models and that the goal of model selection is to find the true model, which in turn requires that the sample size is very large. The Kullback-Leibler based criteria do not assume a true model exists, let alone that it is in the set of models being considered. Based on a review of these criteria, we recommend use of criteria that are based on Kullback-Leibler information in the biological sciences.},

abstract = {Radon, a well-established risk factor for human lung cancer, is present at low concentrations in most homes. Consequently, many countries have established national guidelines for residential radon concentrations. In this article, we evaluate two models for describing seasonal variation in residential radon concentrations based on the data from a large case-control study conducted in Winnipeg, Canada. In this study, radon levels in homes were monitored during two successive 6-month periods, with integrated annual radon concentrations obtained using CR-39 alpha-track detectors. Significant differences were noted among measurements taken during different seasons of the year. Using the model introduced by Pinel et al. (1995) to describe temporal variation in residential radon levels in southwest England using seasonal adjustment factors, reasonable predictions of annual average radon concentrations were obtained from the 6-month integrated radon measurements. However, a simple multiplicative model was found to provide better predictions than the seasonal adjustment model. Although model coefficients vary somewhat from one geographic location to another, the concordance with respect discriminating between results above and below 150 Bq/m(3) in Winnipeg was in the range 85-90{\%} using seasonal adjustment models with coefficients derived from data in either Winnipeg or southwest England.},

abstract = {The Mesoproterozoic Khariar basin, to the SE of Chhattisgarh basin, comprises 1000 m thick arenaceous-argillaceous sediments. For the first time, a multidisciplinary approach has been made to the integrate interpreted satellite imagery, aero-magnetic and aero-radiometric data with available ground exploration data sets with an objective to understand structural fabric and to establish various parameters for unconformity related uranium mineralization in the environs of Khariar basin. Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) anomaly image has been useful to mark major faults (ENE-WSW), magnetic bodies and overall basement characteristics. Combination of first vertical derivative (1VD) and tilt derivative magnetic images brought out presence of NW-SE magnetic linear (dominant) with minor ENE-WSW and NNE-SSW trends. Basic dykes and quartz veins are the surface manifestations of NW-SE trend in basement. Radially averaged power spectrum indicates the approximate basement configuration. Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+) interpretation has shown lineaments along NW-SE, NNE-SSW, ENE-WSW and ENW-WSE directions. These observations are corroborated by interpreted results of magnetic data. Analysis of both results indicate NW-SE and ENE-WSW trends as post depositional. Aero-radiometric images (U, Th, K and ternary U-Th-K) show overall radio-elemental distribution for various litho-units. Besides, Th and K images along with interpreted ETM+ satellite imagery (RGB: 432/752/751) are useful to map small outliers and to modify basement-sediment contact. Geochemical data from basement rocks around Khariar basin suggests the younger Bundeli granitoids and its equivalents are good source of uranium in the western margin. Presence of labile uranium is inferred from higher concentration of uranium in water samples. The Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry (AGRS) and hydro-geochemical anomalies fall along fault zones and intersection of fault zones. The western and southern margin of Khariar basin are also characterized by presence of paleosol at unconformity, which are favorable factors for unconformity type uranium mineralization. Based on the present study, part of western and southern margin emerge as potential target areas for further exploration of uranium. {\textcopyright} 2013 Geological Society of India.},

abstract = {Academic interest in intersectoral partnerships took off in the mid-1990s and the number of publications on this topic has increased rapidly since. This article reviews current academic knowledge on partnerships for sustainable development. This review defines intersectoral partnerships as ‘collaborative arrangements in which actors from two or more spheres of society (state, market and civil society) are involved in a non-hierarchical process, and through which these actors strive for a sustainability goal'. We observe two major perspectives in the partnership literature, focusing on different aspects of the partnership phenomenon and addressing quite distinct questions. The first, the institutional perspective, looks at partnerships as new arrangements in the environmental governance regime. The second, the actor perspective, frames partnerships as possible strategic instruments for the goal achievement and problem solving of individual actors. Our review is organized around these perspectives. We identify the research questions that are being addressed in partnership literature, assess the type of knowledge that has been acquired and identify prevailing knowledge gaps. Important conclusions are, firstly, that research on partnerships has delivered many insights in their functioning and their role in contemporary society. Secondly, the concepts of partnerships and sustainable development are more clearly linked discursively than empirically. The current knowledge base mostly lacks clear definitions of success and therefore criteria for the evaluation of partnerships. Therefore, future research should, on empirical instead of reasoned grounds, pay more attention to the link between intersectoral partnerships and sustainable development. Preferably this should be done in a way that combines the actor and the institutional perspective. Keywords:},

This paper considers whether there is a relationship between the distribution of naturally occurring radon gas and lung cancer incidence in Scotland, for the period 1988-1991. We use regression analysis to test whether exposure to radon was a significant cause of lung cancer in Scotland, once smoking and other possible confounding factors were controlled for. The results demonstrate that for the population aged over 54, there was no significant relationship between radon exposure and lung cancer incidence. However, for those aged less than 55, lung cancer rates were significantly higher in places expected to have the highest levels of radon.

Anthropogenic CO2 is being injected as part of an enhanced oil recovery operation. The European research pays attention on analyzing long-term migration pathways of CO2 and the effects of CO2 on the hydrochemical and mineralogical properties of the reservoir rock. The long-term safety and performance of CO2 storage is assessed by the construction of a Features, Events and Processes (FEP) database that provides a comprehensive knowledge base for the geological storage of CO2. The pre-CO2 injection hydrogeological, hydrochemical, and petrographical conditions in the reservoir are investigated to recognize changes caused by the CO2 flood and assessing the fate of the CO2.

abstract = {During the last three decades, Bayesian methods have developed greatly in the field of epidemiology. Their main challenge focusses around computation, but the advent of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) and in particular of the WinBUGS software has opened the doors of Bayesian modelling to the wide research community. However model complexity and database dimension still remain a constraint.Recently the use of Gaussian random fields has become increasingly popular in epidemiology as very often epidemiological data are characterised by a spatial and/or temporal structure which needs to be taken into account in the inferential process. The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach has been developed as a computationally efficient alternative to MCMC and the availability of an R package (R-INLA) allows researchers to easily apply this method.In this paper we review the INLA approach and present some applications on spatial and spatio-temporal data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the frame of the INGV activities of the Group 5 of the European Platform on Zero Emissions Fossil Fuels Power Plants (Eu ZEP) INGV resumes 8 years of experience in public communication on CCS aimed to the public acceptance of this strategic group of technologies. This paper follows from the beginning (2000-2008) the history of the communication and public acceptance campaign in Italy, discriminating in details the bad/sound messages appeared on newspaper, TV, video and conference, mostly as regard the possible natural risks associated to a newly exploited technology: CO2 Capture {\&} Storage (CCS), namely degassing/leakage to surface and triggering of micro-seismicity typically associated to industrial fluids injection. The most important messages, the mediatic errors and the obstacles encountered during this long communication campaign, mostly exploited by INGV in Italy, are described critically, tentatively avoiding that the involved stakeholders make the same mistakes in future and do not adopt the herewith suggested protocols of communication. This is strategic mostly in densely populated countries, like the European ones, often affected by the NIMBY syndrome (Not In My Back Yard) for new plants which could foreseen the CO2 storage sites in the vicinity. In the frame of the European Directivity on CCS, the above mentioned risks are mainly supported and charged on the "storage operator": and this load is not soundly taken in considerations in the directivity itself: these risks must be spread on the "capture" community and on the "Competent Authority", otherwise the "storage operators" are not encouraged to enter in the CCS market. INGV describes its experience in creating good communication in public populated events like the "Science Festival" held in Lecce (May 2008) and the "Science Festival" held on Genova (October 2008), also by facilities as plastic interactive CCS scaled box reproducing the CO2 storage techniques, for a complete and simple communication with general public and stakeholders. The most important messages to be highlighted on CCS are mentioned and critically reviewed in the newspaper articles since the USA-Italia bilateral agreements on the climate change, including CCS at that time. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Residual and dissolution trapping are important mechanisms for secure geological storage of carbon dioxide. When appraising a potential site, it is desirable to have accurate field-scale estimates of the proportion of trapping by these mechanisms. For this purpose a short single-well test has been conceived that could be implemented before largescale injection. To test this concept in the field, a residual saturation and dissolution test sequence was conducted at the CO2CRC Otway site during 2011. The test involved injection of 150 tonnes of pure carbon dioxide followed by 454 tonnes of formation water to drive the carbon dioxide to residual saturation. A variety of methods for measuring saturation were applied to the injection zone so the results could be compared. Here we provide an overview of the field-test sequence and the measurement methods.},

abstract = {This paper considers some of the impediments to interdisciplinary integration in migration theory, focusing on the problem of combining economics and sociology. It argues that neoclassical economics has a number of methodological advantages, deriving from its elegant theoretical structure and its aptitude for measuring and predicting individual behaviour. However, these features are contingent on a number of simplifying assumptions about social action: Namely, a commitment to methodological individualism, a uniform conception of rationality, and a theory of individuals as utility-maximising. These assumptions become untenable in the case of migration decision-making, which partially accounts for the failure of economics theories adequately to explain and predict migration flows. Instead of rejecting such approaches, however, the article suggests how economics methodologies can be usefully applied within interdisciplinary research: Either as a tool for modelling patterns of migration decision-making already observed through more qualitative methodologies; or as a means of testing and ruling out certain hypotheses about migration decision-making.},

abstract = {Leakage of CO2 or brine coming from CO2 geological storage sites constitutes a risk for overlying fresh groundwater resources. One of the main risks is the potential alteration of groundwater quality by the intrusion of contaminants such as trace elements. This paper reviews studies that address the potential impacts of CO2 geological storage leakage on fresh groundwater quality.Leakage can directly modify the chemical properties of fresh water (pH, redox potential, chemical composition) and, as a result, indirectly modify the effect of biogeochemical processes controlling trace element availability. The ability of a CO2 or brine leak to introduce or mobilize trace elements and potentially degrade the quality of water in an overlying aquifer depends on the composition and quantity of the leaking fluids, the nature of the solid phases making up the aquifer (buffering and scavenging capacity) and the concentrations of undesirable or toxic elements that can be mobilized following any such modification. Furthermore, hydrogeological conditions will control the potential dissemination into groundwater. To date, studies have shown that trace elements can be significantly mobilized without necessarily exceeding quality thresholds. In a few cases where aquifers are naturally rich in trace elements (i.e. whose natural concentrations in groundwater are already high), CO2 is able to mobilize these trace elements (e.g. Fe, Mn, Ni, As, Ba, U) and increase concentrations up to or exceeding threshold values.This literature review provides a return on experience essential for both assessing biogeochemical risks prior to the installation of future CO2 geological storage sites and designing and installing fresh groundwater quality monitoring networks. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The (super 3) He/ (super 4) He ratios of crater fumaroles, corrected for atmospheric contamination, increased significantly from 5.47 R (sub atm) in December 1989 to 7.93 R (sub atm) in August 1990 and reached a maximum of 8.84 R (sub atm) in May 1992. The ratio then decreased gradually until July 1995. Overall variation of helium isotopes appears to be related to the current activity of the volcano. The (super 3) He/ (super 4) He ratios of Pandiaco mineral spring were constant between April 1988 and November 1991 and increased in April 1993, although experimental error is large. The delta (super 13) C values of CO (sub 2) of crater fumaroles show negative correlation to the helium isotopes, while those of Pandiaco are relatively constant. Based on the delta (super 13) C values and CO (sub 2) / (super 3) He ratios, it is possible to estimate fractions of upper mantle carbon in these samples. Calculated mantle fractions are 3-10{\%} in crater fumaroles, while those in Pandiaco spring are negligibly small.},

Standard state Gibbs free energies of formation can be used to describe the solubility of uranyl minerals; therefore, models of the distribution and mobility of uranium in the environment require accurate determination of the Gibbs free energies of formation for a wide range of relevant uranyl minerals. Despite decades of study, the thermodynamic properties for many environmentally-important uranyl minerals are still not well constrained. In this review, we describe the necessary elements for rigorous solubility experiments that can be used to define Gibbs free energies of formation; we summarize published solubility data, point out difficulties in conducting uranyl mineral solubility experiments, and identify areas of future research necessary to construct an internally-consistent thermodynamic database for uranyl minerals.},

Deterministic, data-driven and geostatistics algorithms were used, in some cases adding the elevation information and other physiographic variables to improve the performance of interpolation techniques and the reconstruction of the air temperature field. The dataset is given by air temperature data coming from 84 stations spread around the island of Sicily. The interpolation algorithms were optimized by using a subset of the available dataset, while the remaining subset was used to validate the results in terms of the accuracy and bias of the estimates. Validation results indicate that univariate methods, which neglect the information from physiographic variables, significantly entail the largest errors, while performances improve when such parameters are taken into account. The best results at the annual scale have been obtained using the the ordinary kriging of residuals from linear regression and from the artificial neural network algorithm, while, at the monthly scale, a Fourier-series algorithm has been used to downscale mean annual temperature to reproduce monthly values in the annual cycle.},

abstract = {Until the emergence of the New Economics of Labor Migration (NELM) in the 1980s, migration scholars were largely divided into two main theoretical camps, viz. the neoclassical and historical-structural approaches to migration. Against this background, the NELM presented itself as a theoretical ‘third way' between the two latter approaches, and purported to reconcile agency and structure in a way previously unachieved by either of them. While those pretensions gained a fair amount of acceptance and popularity, this paper argues that they are fundamentally misleading, and that the NELM is little more than a slightly more sophisticated avatar of the neoclassical approach to migration, whose fundamental weaknesses it has not, and cannot, shed. This paper further argues that, in so doing, the NELM effectively constitutes migration theory's own instance of economics imperialism, i.e. the attempt to advance the fundamental tenets of neoclassical economics (methodological individualism and the assumption of optimizing rationality) within the context of the study and interpretation of various social phenomena. In order to put forth these arguments, this paper provides a summary presentation of the standard neoclassical theory of migration, the historical-structural heterodoxy and the NELM; highlights why it is that the NELM should be regarded as a ‘reworked' version of the neoclassical theoretical framework and discusses its inception in the context of the ‘information-theoretic revolution' in economics; and argues for a new and improved ‘historical-structural synthesis' as a more satisfactory alternative to both the NELM and the standard neoclassical theory.},

abstract = {Methane and CO2 emissions from the two most active mud volcanoes in central Japan, Murono and Kamou (Tokamachi City, Niigata Basin), were measured in from both craters or vents (macro-seepage) and invisible exhalation from the soil (mini- and microseepage). Molecular and isotopic compositions of the released gases were also determined. Gas is thermogenic (??13CCH4 from -32.9??? to -36.2???), likely associated with oil, and enrichments of 13C in CO2 (??13CCO2 up to +28.3???) and propane (??13CC3H8 up to -8.6???) suggest subsurface petroleum biodegradation. Gas source and post-genetic alteration processes did not change from 2004 to 2010. Methane flux ranged within the orders of magnitude of 101-104gm-2d-1 in macro-seeps, and up to 446gm-2d-1 from diffuse seepage. Positive CH4 fluxes from dry soil were widespread throughout the investigated areas. Total CH4 emission from Murono and Kamou were estimated to be at least 20 and 3.7tona-1, respectively, of which more than half was from invisible seepage surrounding the mud volcano vents. At the macro-seeps, CO2 fluxes were directly proportional to CH4 fluxes, and the volumetric ratios between CH4 flux and CO2 flux were similar to the compositional CH4/CO2 volume ratio. Macro-seep flux data, in addition to those of other 13 mud volcanoes, supported the hypothesis that molecular fractionation (increase of the "Bernard ratio" C1/(C2+C3)) is inversely proportional to gas migration fluxes. The CH4 "emission factor" (total measured output divided by investigated seepage area) was similar to that derived in other mud volcanoes of the same size and activity. The updated global "emission-factor" data-set, now including 27 mud volcanoes from different countries, suggests that previous estimates of global CH4 emission from mud volcanoes may be significantly underestimated. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The mean activity concentrations in monazite were 40580 ± 1370, 182425 ± 9870 and 11300 ± 9570 Bq kg- 1 for 238U, 232Th and 40K, respectively. This activity is equivalent to 0.39, 5.1 and 4.5 wt{\%} for uranium as U3 O8, thorium as ThO2 and potassium-40 as K2 O, respectively. The radium equivalent activity, absorbed-gamma dose rate and effective annual dose rate in monazite were 3.0 × 105 Bq kg- 1, 1.3 × 105 nGy h- 1 and 163 mSv yr- 1, respectively. The emanation coefficient (EC) of 222Rn was less than 20{\%}. The average Rn EC was 18{\%} for cement samples and ∼ 14 {\%} for granite and ceramic samples. It concluded that the Rosetta beach could be considered a valuable source for some metallurgical processes of industrial interest, but with special precautions. Most of the studied building materials can be used without restrictions except PG wastes, granite and ceramic. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The theory of an in situ method to measure CO2 flux from hydrothermal fumarolic vents using a tracer gas technique is established and applied to vents and wells at three sites: Izu-Oshima (Japan), Kirishima (Japan) and Teide (Canary Islands, Spain) volcanoes. The method is done by releasing the tracer gas into the vent at known flux and by measuring CO2 to the tracer gas ratio in situ. In Izu-Oshima, we carried out flux measurements at a low-temperature steam well (90°C) with three different tracer gas species (H2, CH4 and SF6) and three methods (GC, portable analyzers, FTIR) to evaluate this method. The calculated CO2 flux showed an average of 2.3 t/day. In the case of Kirishima volcanic area, the flux measurement was tested at two low-temperature fumaroles on Iwoyama cone ({\textless}100°C). The CO2 fluxes were 9 × 10-2 and 2 × 100 kg/day, respectively. The total CO2 flux from the cone including both fumarolic and ground CO2 discharges was estimated to be less than several tons per day. In Teide volcano, CO2 flux measurements were performed in the fumarolic system of the summit crater (85°C). CO2 flux from one fumarole reached levels up to 30.2 kg/day. We estimated that the CO2 discharge from all fumaroles is roughly 30 t/day or less at maximum. These results imply that the total output of CO2 flux from Teide's fumarolic activity is much lower than the observed levels of CO2 diffuse degassing from the summit crater. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Major towns include Florence and Pisa. Analyses are presented for 29 water samples from the Arno river and 36 water samples from the tributaries, all collected in 1996-1997 during low flow hydrologic conditions. Samples from the Arno are distributed from source to mouth and those from tributaries upstream from the confluence points. The Arno river solutes consist mainly of Ca2+ and HCO3
-, but the proportions of Na+, Cl- and SO4
2- increase downstream, in keeping with the basically anthropogenic origin of the latter. The ??34S(SO4
2-) signature also increases downstream, with the most depleted values in the source zone. The seawater ingression into the river is documented by distinctly higher chemical and isotopic parameters at about 13 km from the mouth. In general, the tributaries behave similarly to the Arno for both their chemical and isotopic compositions, with increasing ??34S, Na+, Cl- and SO4
2- downstream. The ??34S of SO4
2- in natural inputs is estimated to range approximately between -15 and +4??? from oxidation of pyrite disseminated in country rocks, and between +15 and +23??? from dissolution of evaporites, whereas the ??34S of anthropogenic SO4

abstract = {The article describes the R-package constrainedKriging, a tool for spatial prediction problems that involve change of support. The package provides software for spatial interpolation by constrained (CK), covariance-matching constrained (CMCK), and customary universal (UK) kriging. CK and CMCK yield approximately unbiased predictions of nonlinear functionals of target quantities under change of support and are therefore an attractive alternative to conditional Gaussian simulations. The constrainedKriging package computes CK, CMCK, and UK predictions for points or blocks of arbitrary shape from data observed at points in a two-dimensional survey domain. Predictions are computed for a random process model that involves a nonstationary mean function (modeled by a linear regression) and a weakly stationary, isotropic covariance function (or variogram). CK, CMCK, and UK require the point-block and block-block averages of the covariance function if the prediction targets are blocks. The constrainedKriging package uses numerically efficient approximations to compute these averages. The article contains, apart from a brief summary of CK and CMCK, a detailed description of the algorithm used to compute the point-block and block-block covariances, and it describes the functionality of the software in detail. The practical use of the package is illustrated by a comparison of universal and constrained lognormal block kriging for the Meuse Bank heavy metal data set. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Gweru Rural district in the Midlands province of Zimbabwe has witnessed an increasing number of outward migrations of breadwinners, leaving behind a desperate environment for families. This study was motivated by the realisation that most of the sick left behind, the elderly and children would visit the health centres unaccompanied, risking taking prescribed drugs incorrectly, thus further compromising their health. The study sought to establish the socio-economic effects of international migration on family members left behind in ward 8 of Gweru Rural. The study adopted a qualitative case study approach. Focus group discussions, questionnaires and structured individual interviews were used to elicit for data. Non-probability sampling design was used because of small samples available. Convenience and purposive sampling techniques were particularly used. Data were manually analysed and presented both qualitatively and quantitatively. The study revealed that international migration particularly to South Africa, especially by non- professionals, was not yielding the much expected economic gains; instead it was characterised by more negative social effects on the emigrant's family. The study recommends that emigrants should consider migrating with their loved ones and, where it is not feasible, to put in place sound alternative caregiving arrangements. The study has provided an insight into international migration and its effects on left-behind families. However, a more comprehensive and quantitative survey remains critical to delving deeper into this migration phenomenon, particularly on how both the emigrant and left-behind spouses handle the issue of conjugal rights.},

@article{Robock2000,
abstract = {Volcanic eruptions are an important natural cause of climate change on many timescales. A new capability to predict the climatic response to a large tropical eruption for the succeeding 2 years will prove valuable to society. In addition, to detect and attribute anthropogenic influences on climate, including effects of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and ozone-depleting chemicals, it is crucial to quantify the natural fluctuations so as to separate them from anthropogenic fluctuations in the climate record. Studying the responses of climate to volcanic eruptions also helps us to better understand important radiative and dynamical processes that respond in the climate system to both natural and anthropogenic forcings. Furthermore, modeling the effects of volcanic eruptions helps us to improve climate models that are needed to study anthropogenic effects. Large volcanic eruptions inject sulfur gases into the stratosphere, which convert to sulfate aerosols with an e-folding residence time of about 1 year. Large ash particles fall out much quicker. The radiative and chemical effects of this aerosol cloud produce responses in the climate system. By scattering some solar radiation back to space, the aerosols cool the surface, but by absorbing both solar and terrestrial radiation, the aerosol layer heats the stratosphere. For a tropical eruption this heating is larger in the tropics than in the high latitudes, producing an enhanced pole-to-equator temperature gradient, especially in winter. In the Northern Hemisphere winter this enhanced gradient produces a stronger polar vortex, and this stronger jet stream produces a characteristic stationary wave pattern of tropospheric circulation, resulting in winter warming of Northern Hemisphere continents. This indirect advective effect on temperature is stronger than the radiative cooling effect that dominates at lower latitudes and in the summer. The volcanic aerosols also serve as surfaces for heterogeneous chemical reactions that destroy stratospheric ozone, which lowers ultraviolet absorption and reduces the radiative heating in the lower stratosphere, but the net effect is still heating. Because this chemical effect depends on the presence of anthropogenic chlorine, it has only become important in recent decades. For a few days after an eruption the amplitude of the diurnal cycle of surface air temperature is reduced under the cloud. On a much longer timescale, volcanic effects played a large role in interdecadal climate change of the Little Ice Age. There is no perfect index of past volcanism, but more ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica will improve the record. There is no evidence that volcanic eruptions produce El Ni{\~{n}}o events, but the climatic effects of El Ni{\~{n}}o and volcanic eruptions must be separated to understand the climatic response to each.},

The empirical data may provide guidance in estimating potential leakage rates without requiring detailed assumptions on the geometry and dimension of the flow path. Achievability of such containment can be assessed in risk and uncertainty analyses that consider the occurrence of unlikely events inducing leakage. Envisaged leakage mechanisms are flow driven by buoyancy and overpressure through permeable zones in the top seal of storage reservoirs, along permeable faults and damaged well bores. Seepage rates from natural CO2 accumulations with non-optimum seals, flow rates from natural gas storage, and fluid discharge rates related to earthquakes indicates potential leakage rates for risk and uncertainty analysis.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of financial development on the rural-urban income inequality in India using annual data from 1965 to 2008. Design/methodology/approach: The Ng-Perron unit root test is utilised to check for the order of integration of the variables. The long run relation is examined by implementing the ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration. Findings: The results confirm a relation among the variables. Evidence suggest that financial development, economic growth and consumer prices aggravate rural-urban income inequality in the long run. Research limitations/implications: The present study offers fresh insights to policy makers on crafting appropriate policies that reduce rural-urban income inequality in India. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is lies in extending the literature in the context of India towards an extensively researched area of rural-urban divide but in time series framework and utilization of a better approach of time series approach, i.e. ARDL. Specifically, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical study to test poverty-finance nexus using the basic principles of the GJ hypothesis and provide evidence of short- and long-run dynamics on the postulated relation for India. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

                        2 is removed from produced natural gas and re-injected below the gas-water contact on the flanks of the reservoir. The biological work was the first such study undertaken at the site. Observations were made in: uplifted areas around the three CO

Near ground atmospheric measurements were made with a mobile open path laser system, with soil gas and flux measurements in support of these and of a botanical and microbiological survey. Longer term monitoring was initiated for radon and other gases using buried probes and activated charcoal integrative collectors. Laser measurements appeared to show only natural variations, but interference from the vehicle exhaust, windblown dust and rain was apparent. Modifications are needed to overcome these problems. Natural variation of atmospheric CO
                        2 needs to be better constrained to identify anomalous values. Soil gas concentrations and fluxes were very low but slightly higher values over the KB-5 well could indicate low-level leakage. This is likely to be a legacy of breakthrough prior to the abandonment of the well. A variety of monocotyledonous and dicotyledenous plants was present, particularly in dry wadis or shallow depressions. The xerophytic flora and the microbial numbers were typical of such desert environments and the data provide baseline values since there were no indications of elevated CO

abstract = {The fate of divalent radium (Ra2+) in high ionic strength systems is an important issue with relevant aspects to environmental concerns. As a consequence, the description of the thermodynamic properties of Ra2+ in such systems is a critical matter which was not addressed yet. This can be done using the Pitzer formalism, which is regarded as the most accurate approach to describe activity coefficients of aquatic species in high ionic strength solutions. Isopiestic measurements, measurements of the electromotive force or the solubility of RaSO4,S in NaCl solutions, which are essential for the evaluation of the Pitzer ion interaction parameters, were not experimentally tested, due to the high radioactivity concentration which involves such experiments. Therefore, the present study examined the possibility to extrapolate the RaCl2 cation–anion interaction parameters ($\beta$(0), $\beta$(1) and Cϕ) by linear regression of other MCl2 cation–anion interaction parameters with their respective hydrated ionic radii (M2+=Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+). $\gamma$Ra2+ calculated with the estimated RaCl2 parameters revealed that the ratios of activity coefficients $\gamma$Mg2+/$\gamma$Ba2+{\textgreater}$\gamma$Ca2+/$\gamma$Ba2+{\textgreater}$\gamma$Sr2+/$\gamma$Ba2+{\textgreater}1{\textgreater}$\gamma$Ra2+/$\gamma$Ba2+ follow the opposite order of the ratios of hydrated ionic radii RMg2+/RBa2+{\textless}RCa2+/RBa2+{\textless}RSr2+/RBa2+{\textless}1{\textless}RRa2+/RBa2+. The activity coefficient of Ra2+, $\gamma$Ra2+, calculated with these estimated values is used to test the limitation of the common assumption that the activity coefficients ratio, $\gamma$Ra2+/$\gamma$Ba2+, is close to unity. It is found that the common assumption of $\gamma$Ra2+/$\gamma$Ba2+=1 may be considered reasonable up to high NaCl concentration. The largest deviation in the $\gamma$Ra2+/$\gamma$Ba2+ ratio from this assumption was of the order of ∼25{\%} in the range of halite solubility (6molkg−1 of NaCl). However, experimental results of co-precipitation of Ra2+ in barite are described with more accuracy when the estimated RaCl2 Pitzer parameters are used. These results are described in a consecutive paper of this journal.},

Many efforts arc being put towards developing new techniques to capture CO2 from industrial emitters. However, it is necessary to store CO2 in a safe manner. Techniques applied to develop a suitable emplacement are well known, since these are similar to that for oil or gas explorations. Nonetheless, successful site selection (screen phase) will decrease the inherent risk in the geological exploration (assessment and select phase). In this process, many criteria should be taken into consideration, including technical and socio-economical aspects. For this purpose, different mathematical algorithms have been developed to solve multicriteria problems and to help the decision-makers. This article describes a methodology for the selection of site areas or structures for storing CO2 based on a multicriteria algorithm, which will rank the areas under consideration, in order to select the most suitable or promising emplacement.},

abstract = {Soil spectral reflectance is the comprehensive representation of soil physical and chemical parameters, and its study is the physical basis for soil remote sensing and provides a new way and standard for soil properties themselves' research. Soil room spectra significantly correlate with that derived from hyperspectral images. So the room spectra are very important for soil taxonomy and investigation. To seek for the feasibility of soil taxonomy on the basis of topsoil reflectance spectral characteristics, and provide the theory foundation for quick soil taxonomy based on remote sensing methods, the spectral reflectance in the visible and near infrared region (400-2 500 nm) of 248 soil samples (black soil, chernozem, meadow soil, blown soil, alluvial soil) collected from Nongan county, Jilin province was measured with a hyperspectral device in room, and the soil spectral characteristics were determined with continuum removal method, and soil spectral indices (spectral absorption area, depth and asymmetry) were computed, which were introduced into BP network models as external input variables. The models consist of three layers (input, output and hidden layer), the training function is "TRAINLM", learning function "LEARNGDM", and transferring function "TAN SIG". The results showed that: (1) There are some differences among different soils in their spectral characteristics, but with similar parental matrix and climate, the spectral differences of soils in Nongan county are not significant. So it's difficult to analyze soil spectral characteristics based on soil reflectance. (2) The curves after continuum removal strengthened soil spectral absorption characteristics, and simplified soil spectral analysis. The soil spectral curves in Nongan county mainly have five spectral absorption vales at 494, 658, 1 415, 1 913 and 2 206 nm, and the former two vales are caused by soil organic matter, Fe and mechanical composition, the latter three are due to soil moisture; the differences of the latter three vales among different soils are not apparent, and the significant differences are in the former two vales region. (3) Soil reflectance is sensitive to organic matter, soil moisture, Fe, mechanical composition, roughness, and so on. The sensitivity of soil spectral indices derived with continuum removing method is decreased. Then the models with these indices as input variables are more stable and general. As the input variables were external, the BP network model based on the former two vales' shape characteristics was better than that based on reflectance values or all five vales, the classifying accuracy of the main three soils (chernozem, meadow soil, blown soil) was bigger than 60{\%}, and the model could be used for soil taxonomy. However, this work still needs further study, and to improve classifying accuracy, auxiliary data, such as topography, vegetation, and land use should be introduced.},

abstract = {n the frame of the geochemical monitoring of seismicity mainly aimed at deepening the relationships between active seismotectonics and fluid geochemistry, i.e. earthquake prediction, a 222 Rn study was accomplished. It is addressed to inter-calibrate in diverse tectonic settings different methods to measure radon in groundwater: Alpha Scintillation Method using Lucas Cells (ASM-LCC) and Gamma Spectrometry Method (GSM), adopting both the Charcoal Trap Method (CTM) by Active Charcoals Canisters (ACC) and the Beaker Marinelli (BM) sampling devices. The intercalibration occurred on the field as well as in the laboratory, to finally select the best-fitting to gather radon information in each situation. Three Italian areas were selected to verify radon behavior and background concentration in different seismotectonical, geo-structural and lithological settings: ancient metamorphosed rocks – quiescent faults (Eastern Alps), carbonate foreland – active faults (Gargano) and quiescent volcanic structure overlapping a carbonate basement – swarm seismic activity (Colli Albani). The high radon concentration variability and the factors affecting radon behavior in groundwater (i.e. carrier gases presence, convection along fault systems, lithology influence, etc.) strongly constrain the measurement method to be adopted. The results point out apparently that the ASM-LCC method may be useful for expeditious and quick response of groundwater radon concentration during geochemical surveys aimed at grossly detecting the presence of tectonic structures, the deepening of circulation or the peculiar geological features linked to the presence of U-Th minerals. This method is not reliable for accurate measurements, while the GSM methods showed low standard deviation (higher precision with respect ASM-LCC) and accurate radon measurements. Finally, a customized DINCE Standard Radiactive Source (DSRS) was set up, and first used for the efficient estimation of the ING available Lucas Cells. A calibration factor for each ING Lucas Cell was defined and the most critical aspects of the ASM-LCC method revised.},

Sizing and fit issues such as the excessive length and bulkiness of glove fingers were identified as a major concern regarding fire gloves resulting in limited mobility and dexterity, negatively effecting firefighters' work efficiency and safety. The integrity of protection in the interface between turnout ensemble, gloves and boots was reported as an important consideration for firefighter comfort, mobility and protection against heat hazards.

abstract = {Research shows that the association between adverse climate conditions and human migration is heterogeneous. One reason for this heterogeneity is the differential vulnerability of populations to climate change. This includes highly vulnerable, “trapped” populations that are too poor to migrate given deep and persistent poverty, the financial costs of migrating, and the erosion of already fragile economic livelihoods under climate change. Another reason for this heterogeneity is the differential vulnerability of places. However, despite the growing list of studies showing that the climate-migration relationship clearly varies across places, there is surprisingly little research on the characteristics of places themselves that trap, or immobilize, populations. Accordingly, we provide the first account of the “holding power” of places in the association between adverse climate conditions and migration flows among 55 districts in Zambia in 2000 and 2010. Methodologically, we combine high-resolution climate information with aggregated census micro data to estimate gravity models of inter-district migration flows. Results reveal that the association between adverse climate conditions and migration is positive only for wealthy migrant-sending districts. In contrast, poor districts are characterized by climate-related immobility. Yet, our findings show that access to migrant networks enables climate-related mobility in the poorest districts, suggesting a viable pathway to overcome mobility constraints. Planners and policy makers need to recognize the holding power of places that can trap populations and develop programs to support in situ adaptation and to facilitate migration to avoid humanitarian emergencies.},

abstract = {Radon concentration as a function of the soil depth (0-2.6 m) was measured during the years 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 on the Aristotle University campus. Radium distribution in soil was found constant. On the contrary, as expected, radon concentration increased with soil depth. However, the radon concentration did not follow the well known monotonous increase, which levels off to a saturation value. In both radon distributions, radon concentration increased up to a soil depth of about 80 cm, seemed to remain constant at depths of 80-130 cm, and then increased again. The experimental distribution was reproduced by solving the general transport equation (diffusion and advection). The main finding of the numerical investigation is that the aforementioned, experimentally observed, profile of radon concentration can be explained theoretically by the existence of two soil layers with different diffusion-advection characteristics. Soil sample analysis verified the existence of two different soil layers. Different boundary conditions of the radon concentration at the soil surface were used for the solution of the diffusion-advection equation. It was found that the calculated radon concentration in the soil is, away from the soil surface, the same for the two boundary conditions used. However, from the (frequently used) boundary condition of zero radon concentration at the soil surface, the experimental profile of the radon concentration at the soil surface cannot be deduced. On the contrary, with more appropriate boundary conditions the radon concentration at the soil surface could be deduced from the experimental profile. The equivalent diffusion coefficient could be uncovered from the experimental profile, which can then be used to estimate the radon current, which is important, for example, for the estimation of radon entrance to dwellings.},

abstract = {Soil respiration rates vary significantly among major plant biomes, suggesting that vegetation type influences the rate of soil respiration. However, correlations among climatic factors, vegetation distributions, and soil respiration rates make cause-effect arguments difficult. Vegetation may affect soil respiration by influencing soil microclimate and structure, the quantity of detritus supplied to the soil, the quality of that detritus, and the overall rate of root respiration. At the global scale, soil respiration rates correlate positively with litterfall rates in forests, as previously reported, and with aboveground net primary productivity in grasslands, providing evidence of the importance of detritus supply. To determine the direction and magnitude of the effect of vegetation type on soil respiration, we collated data from published studies where soil respiration rates were measured simultaneously in two or more plant communities. We found no predictable differences in soil respiration between cropped and vegetation-free soils, between forested and cropped soils, or between grassland and cropped soils, possibly due to the diversity of crops and cropping systems included. Factors such as temperature, moisture availability, and substrate properties that simultaneously influence the production and consumption of organic matter are more important in controlling the overall rate of soil respiration than is vegetation type in most cases. However, coniferous forests had similar to 10{\%} lower rates of soil respiration than did adjacent broad-leaved forests growing on the same soil type, and grasslands had, on average, similar to 20{\%} higher soil respiration rates than did comparable forest stands, demonstrating that vegetation type does in some cases significantly affect rates of soil respiration.

abstract = {Many physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils exhibit skewed distributions that can be approximated by the two-parameter lognormal distribution. Recent attention in the soils literature has focused on the best method of estimating the mean for lognormally distributed variables; however, little attention has been given to methods for constructing confidence intervals about the mean of such variables. This paper reports on the efficacy of five different methods, one exact and four approximate, for constructing confidence intervals about the mean of a lognormally distributed variable. These methods were examined over a range of sample sizes (n = 6–100) by using Monte Carlo simulation to draw samples from four lognormal distributions with known mean and variances (coefficients of variation of 50, 100, 200, and 500{\%}). Performance of the confidence-interval methods were assessed by identifying how close the calculated probability levels for the upper and lower confidence limits came to the stated probability levels. Two commonly applied methods, the asymptotic and Patterson's methods, failed to provide accurate probabilistic coverage. A nonparametric method developed by the authors was superior to both of these methods and compared favorably with Land's method in some cases. The latter is an exact method that gives the correct probabilistic coverage. The third method, attributed to Cox, was generally inferior to Land's and our nonparametric method, although it outperformed the asymptotic and Patterson's methods. For precise work, Land's method should be employed for constructing confidence intervals about the mean of a lognormally distributed variable.},

abstract = {Drivers can be understood as forces leading to the inception of migration and the perpetuation of movement. This article considers key drivers of migration and explores different ways that they may be configured. We modify existing explanations of migration to generate a framework which we call push-pull plus. To understand migration flows better, analysts could usefully distinguish between predisposing, proximate, precipitating and mediating drivers. Combinations of such drivers shape the conditions, circumstances and environment within which people choose to move or stay put, or have that decision thrust upon them. In any one migration flow, several driver complexes may interconnect to shape the eventual direction and nature of movement. The challenge is to establish when and why some drivers are more important than others, which combinations are more potent than others, and which are more susceptible to change through external intervention. Drawing on Afghan and Somali movements featuring ‘mixed migration', the article concludes that proximate and mediating drivers, rather than those in the structural and precipitating spheres, appear to offer greater potential for intervention. To be effective, though, migration policy should be understood not simply as a stand-alone lever, but within the wider political economy.},

abstract = {Discharge of hydrothermal fluids at La Solfatara is one of the many pieces of evidence testifying to the level of activity and the potential danger characterizing the volcanic complex of the Phlegrean Fields. Recent measurements of diffuse degassing shed light on the unexpected magnitude of this process and prompted further research to improve our understanding of the hydrothermal system feeding the surface phenomenon at La Solfatara. In this work, we first present new data on CO2 diffuse degassing, that were collected during a campaign in July 2000, and confirm previous measurements of the degassing rate. These data, together with other information on subsurface structures and conditions, provided the necessary constraints to perform physical modelling of the hydrothermal fluid circulation at La Solfatara. Numerical simulations describe the ascent and evolution of a hot, multi-phase and multi-component fluid, composed of water and carbon dioxide, through a homogeneous, porous medium. When certain system properties and conditions are used this model reproduces some of the main features which characterize the natural system, including the energy budget associated with the ascent and condensation of hot fluids, and the development of a single-phase gas region whose existence was inferred from independent chemical data. Further simulations investigated the effects associated with changes in rock properties and fluid injection rates. Results showed that an increase in the permeability at shallow depth may have an important influence on the system conditions and fluid discharge. They imply that surface phenomena, accompanied by very high temperatures at shallow depths may survive long after deep feeding has ceased. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Global warming and climate change concerns have triggered global efforts to reduce the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is considered a crucial strategy for meeting CO2 emission reduction targets. In this paper, various aspects of CCS are reviewed and discussed including the state of the art technologies for CO2 capture, separation, transport, storage, leakage, monitoring, and life cycle analysis. The selection of specific CO2 capture technology heavily depends on the type of CO2 generating plant and fuel used. Among those CO2 separation processes, absorption is the most mature and commonly adopted due to its higher efficiency and lower cost. Pipeline is considered to be the most viable solution for large volume of CO2 transport. Among those geological formations for CO2 storage, enhanced oil recovery is mature and has been practiced for many years but its economical viability for anthropogenic sources needs to be demonstrated. There are growing interests in CO2 storage in saline aquifers due to their enormous potential storage capacity and several projects are in the pipeline for demonstration of its viability. There are multiple hurdles to CCS deployment including the absence of a clear business case for CCS investment and the absence of robust economic incentives to support the additional high capital and operating costs of the whole CCS process. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Methods have been developed by many researchers to measure radon diffusion coefficient. We developed an updated experimental system to estimate radon diffusion coefficients for typical types of soil in Japan and applied it to a typical loam with different water saturation levels (0-0.82). The system consists of a passive-type scintillation cell, soil column, accumulation tank, and radon source. The radon concentration in the accumulation tank is kept stable, and radon diffused through the soil column is continuously measured with the passive-type scintillation cell. We found the radon diffusion coefficients vary from 9.60 × 10(-6) m(2) s(-1) to 1.27 × 10(-7) m(2) s(-1) for the loam samples. Generally, the diffusion coefficients are almost constant for a water saturation range of 0-0.4 and decrease with increasing water saturation from 0.4 to 0.82.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review 32 studies on firefighters and to quantitatively and qualitatively determine the cancer risk using a meta-analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive search of computerized databases and bibliographies from identified articles was performed. Three criteria used to assess the probable, possible, or unlikely risk for 21 cancers included pattern of meta-relative risks, study type, and heterogeneity testing. RESULTS: The findings indicated that firefighters had a probable cancer risk for multiple myeloma with a summary risk estimate (SRE) of 1.53 and 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) of 1.21-1.94, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SRE = 1.51, 95{\%} CI = 1.31-1.73), and prostate (SRE = 1.28; 95{\%} CI = 1.15-1.43). Testicular cancer was upgraded to probable because it had the highest summary risk estimate (SRE = 2.02; 95{\%} CI = 1.30-3.13). Eight additional cancers were listed as having a "possible" association with firefighting. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm previous findings of an elevated metarelative risk for multiple myeloma among firefighters. In addition, a probable association with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate, and testicular cancer was demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.},

abstract = {Point: Yes, it's too high risk NATURE | COMMENT Extracting gas from shale increases the availability of this resource, but the health and environmental risks may be too high. Subject terms: Environmental science Policy Business Natural gas extracted from shale comes at too great a cost to the environment, say Robert W. Howarth and Anthony Ingraffea. Natural gas from shale is widely promoted as clean compared with oil and coal, a 'win–win' fuel that can lessen emissions while still supplying abundant fossil energy over coming decades until a switch to renewable energy sources is made. But shale gas isn't clean, and shouldn't be used as a bridge fuel. Shale rock formations can contain vast amounts of natural gas (which is mostly methane). Until quite recently, most of this gas was not economically obtainable, because shale is far less permeable than the rock formations exploited for conventional gas. Over the past decade or so, two new technologies have combined to allow extraction of shale gas: 'high-volume, slick-water hydraulic fracturing' (also known as 'fracking'), in which high-pressure water with additives is used to increase fissures in the rock; and precision drilling of wells that can follow the contour of a shale layer closely for 3 kilometres or more at depths of more than 2 kilometres (see 'Fracking for fuel'). Industry first experimented with these two technologies in Texas about 15 years ago. Significant shale-gas production in other states, including Arkansas, Pennsylvania and Louisiana, began only in 2007–09. Outside North America, only a handful of shale-gas wells have been drilled.},

abstract = {Italy is one of the most promising prone areas to study the CO2 behavior underground, the caprock integrity to the CO2 leakage, mostly in presence of pervious/geochemically active faults, due to a wide availability of CO2 rich reservoirs at a depth between 1 and 10 km, as highlighted by recent literature. These deep CO2 reservoirs generate at least 200 leakage areas at surface throughout Italy which have been defined "Diffuse Degassing Structures" (DDS) by INGV. These are widely studied by INGV institutionally by a long term convention with the Civil Protection Department (DPC) with the aim to catalog, monitor and assess the Natural Gas Hazard (NGH, namely the probability of an area to become a site of poisonous peri-volcanic gas exhalation from soils). More than 150 researcher of INGV are involved in monitoring areas affected by the CO2 presence underground and at surface, by continuous monitoring on-line networks (around 40 stations throughout Italy, including the Etna area, Aeolian Islands, Umbria region, Piemonte region, etc.) and discretely (9 groups of research were involved in the last years to localize, define and monitor almost all the DDSs in Italy), by sampling and analyzing chemical and isotopic compounds, useful to discriminate the origin, evolution and natural gas hazards of the examined DDS. In this paper, we will discuss some DDS catalogued and studied by a Rome INGV Research Unit (UR 11) which focused its work in Central Italy, throughout different DDS, also in relation to the diverse seismotectonic settings, to discover buried faults as possible gas leakage pathways, mostly if they are "geochemically" activated. In particular we discuss, among the discrete monitoring techniques exploited by INGV, soil gas surveying, which consists in a collection of gas samples from the soil zone not saturated (dry zone) to measure the geogas gaseous species both in fluxes (CO2, CH4, 222Rn) and in concentration (He, H2, H2S, helium, hydrogen, CO2, CH4, 222Rn), that permeate the soil pores. The total CO2 flux budget was calculated as "baseline" degassing rate of these " CO2 analogues". A good discrete areal monitoring is prerequisite to design sound continuous monitoring network to monitor CO2 related parameters in liquid/gas phases, to review the protocol of the Annex II of the European Directivity on CCS. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Landscape position, grazing, and seasonal variation in precipitation and temperature create spatial and temporal variability in soil processes, and plant biomass and composition in grasslands. However, it is unclear how this variation in plant and soil properties affects carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of grazing, topographic position, and seasonal variation in soil moisture and temperature on plant assimilation, shoot and soil respiration, and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). Carbon dioxide fluxes, vegetation, and environmental variables were measured once a month inside and outside long-term ungulate exclosures in hilltop (dry) to slope bottom (mesic) grassland throughout the 2004 growing season in Yellowstone National Park. There was no difference in vegetation properties and CO2 fluxes between the grazed and the ungrazed sites. The spatial and temporal variability in CO2 fluxes were related to differences in aboveground biomass and total shoot nitrogen content, which were both related to variability in soil moisture. All sites were CO2 sinks (NEE{\textgreater}0) for all our measurements taken throughout the growing season; but CO2 fluxes were four- to fivefold higher at sites supporting the most aboveground biomass located at slope bottoms, compared to the sites with low biomass located at hilltops or slopes. The dry sites assimilated more CO2 per gram aboveground biomass and stored proportionally more of the gross-assimilated CO2 in the soil, compared to wet sites. These results indicate large spatio-temporal variability of CO2 fluxes and suggest factors that control the variability in Yellowstone National Park.},

The investigation consisted of soil CO2 flux measurements along traverses orthogonal to the main faults and eruptive fissures of the volcano. Anomalous levels of soil degassing were found mainly in coincidence with faults, whereas only 49{\%} of the eruptive fissures were found to produce elevated CO2 soil fluxes. This result suggests that only zones of strain are able to channel deep gases to the surface. According to this hypothesis, several previously unknown structures are suggested. Based on our geochemical data, new structural maps of different areas of Etna are proposed. The soil CO2 fluxes observed in this study are higher than those measured in a 1987 study, and they are consistent with the higher level of volcanic unrest during the current study.},

The ground surface is the widest available area over which a permanent control of possible leaks may be performed, and also a privileged area where to investigate to which extent a leak at the reservoir depth may disturb the superficial environment. In this article, we suggest several surface surveillance guidelines inspired from data originating from an EOR-CO 2 oil field case study where an extensive survey of surface and reservoir gas has been performed. This study shows that the gases that may leak from a CO2 geological storage can have a wide range of compositions, both molecular and isotopic. The complexity in the gas source is further impacted by the likely changes in gas (or more generally fluid) composition on the leaking pathway. With such heterogeneity and variability in mind, the task of monitoring a leak at the surface becomes a serious challenge. Furthermore, comparing natural background fluxes of CO2 with expected fluxes in worst case leak scenarios shows that both have comparable amplitudes (???0.4 mol/m2/day). The flux of CO2 itself, or the CO2 content of the soil are of limited interest with respect to a leak detection. Using calculations based on the Dusty Gas Model, we show that the coupling of carbon isotopes and the noble gases with flux measurements is a powerful monitoring method, able to discriminate the flux contribution of a leak in the flux range of the natural baseline. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Measurements of soil fluxes of hydrothermal gases, with special emphasis on C6H6, as well as chemical composition of mono-aromatic compounds in fumaroles and air, were carried out in April 2012 at the Solfatara crater (Campi Flegrei, Southern Italy) to investigate the distribution and behavior of these species as they migrate through the soil from their deep source to the atmosphere. Soil fluxes of CO2, CH4 and C6H6 exhibit good spatial correlation, suggesting that diffuse degassing is mainly controlled by local fractures. The calculated total output of diffuse C6H6 from Solfatara is 0.10kgday-1, whereas fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are 79??103 and 1.04kgday-1, respectively. A comparison between soil gas fluxes and fumarole composition reveals that within the crater soil CH4 is significantly affected by oxidation processes, which are more efficient for low gas fluxes, being dependent on the residence time of the uprising hydrothermal gases at shallow depth. Benzene degradation, mainly proceeding through oxidation via benzoate, seems to be strongly controlled by the presence of a shallow SO42--rich aquifer located in the central and southwestern sectors of the crater, suggesting that the process is particularly efficient when SO42- acts as terminal electron acceptor (SO4 reduction). Relatively high C6H6/C7H8 ratios, typical of hydrothermal fluids, were measured in air close to the main fumarolic field of Solfatara crater. Here, C6H6 concentrations, whose detection limit is {\~{}}0.1??gm-3, are more than one order of magnitude higher than the limit value for ambient air (5??gm-3). This suggests that hydrothermal fluids have a strong impact on air quality in the immediate surroundings of the fumarolic vents. Significant concentrations of endogenous mono-aromatics were also detected in air samples collected from the northern and western sides of the crater, where these gas compounds are mostly fed by diffuse degassing through the crater bottom soil. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Biofilms serve essential ecosystem functions and are used in different technical applications. Studies from stream ecology and waste-water treatment have shown that biofilm functionality depends to a great extent on community structure. Here we present a fast and easy-to-use method for individual cell-based analysis of stream biofilms, based on stain-free flow cytometry and visualization of the high-dimensional data by viSNE. The method allows the combined assessment of community structure, decay of phototrophic organisms and presence of abiotic particles. In laboratory experiments, it allows quantification of cellular decay and detection of survival of larger cells after temperature stress, while in the field it enables detection of community structure changes that correlate with known environmental drivers (flow conditions, dissolved organic carbon, calcium) and detection of microplastic contamination. The method can potentially be applied to other biofilm types, for example, for inferring community structure for environmental and industrial research and monitoring.},

abstract = {Introduction: Our aim was to update global lung cancer epidemiology and describe changing trends and disparities. Methods: We presented country-specific incidence and mortality from GLOBOCAN 2012 by region and socioeconomic factors via the Human Development Index (HDI). Between- and within-country incidence by histological type was analyzed by using International Agency for Research on Cancer data on cancer incidence on five continents. Trend analyses including data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, cancer registries, and theWHOmortality database were conducted using joinpoint regression. Survival was compared between and within countries and by histological type. Results: In 2012, there were 1.82 and 1.59 million new lung cancer cases and deaths worldwide, respectively. Incidence was highest in countries with a very high HDI and lowest in countries with a low HDI (42.2 versus 7.9 in 100,000 for males and 21.8 versus 3.1 in 100,000 for females, respectively). In most countries with a very high HDI, as incidence in males decreased gradually (ranging from -0.3{\%} in Spain to -2.5{\%} in the United States each year), incidence in females continued to increase (with the increase ranging from 1.4{\%} each year in Australia to 6.1{\%} in recent years in Spain). Although histological type varied between countries, adenocarcinoma was more common than squamous cell carcinoma, particularly among females (e.g., in Chinese females, the adenocarcinoma-to-squamous cell carcinoma ratio was 6.6). Five-year relative survival varied from 2{\%} (Libya) to 30{\%} (Japan), with substantial within-country differences. Conclusions: Lung cancer will continue to be a major health problem well through the first half of this century. Preventive strategies, particularly tobacco control, tailored to populations at highest risk are key to reducing the global burden of lung cancer.},

Although no specific radiological constraints on effluent monitoring and release or on waste disposal have yet been imposed on NORM industries in Spain, other environmental regulations have achieved a substantial reduction on the phosphate industry impact. Nevertheless, a more efficient control could be established by eliminating the current conceptual and practical separation of chemical and radioactive risks in NORM industries.

The correlations between petrographic features, determined by X-ray fluorescence, and volcanological history of the island highlight a gradual differentiation with younger rocks showing a more acid chemical composition than the older ones. Radiometric features, and in particular the content of primordial radionuclides 238U, 232Th and 40K, have been measured through gamma-ray spectrometry with hyper-pure germanium detector. The different volcanic lithologies, such as basalts, andesites and rhyolites, have been characterized by petrographic diagrams. The calculated dose rate has also been used as an additional classification parameter. Older products show low alkali content than the younger ones. This is related with the increasing of incompatible elements, such as uranium and thorium, in the younger products.

Another site (Naft??a Lake) with remarkable gas emissions (bubbling gas into a lake as well as adjacent areas of diffuse soil degassing) is located further southwest of Mt. Etna in an area of extinct Quaternary volcanism on the northwest margin of Hyblean Mts. In all of these areas the origin of the highest CO2 emissions is clearly magmatic, and degassing to the atmosphere occurs mostly through tectonic structures, probably at a regional scale. The magmatic source that feeds anomalous degassing in the above areas is likely to be the same that feeds volcanic activity at Mt. Etna. Focused degassing was measured at each emission vent using devices that measure the air speed, whereas diffuse soil degassing was measured using the accumulation chamber method. In total, 712 measurements were carried out (146 in focused degassing vents, 566 on diffuse degassing areas). Single CO2 output values ranged from 1.8 10- 5 to 1.68??kg s- 1. In the case of diffuse degassing areas, statistical analyses allowed to discriminate between biogenic CO2 and CO2 deriving from a magmatic-hydrothermal source. Only the efflux values from the latter source were considered in the output estimates. The total estimated output thus obtained was about 2.61??kg s- 1, relevant to a total surface of about 146,500??m2 (which includes only the magmatic CO2 emissions). This value is comparable with that of most non-volcanic emissions from geothermal and/or faulted areas of central-southern Italy, as well with the CO2 output from some of the volcanic areas of Italy. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Radioactive materials are treated and transformed mainly in nuclear industries. However, non-nuclear industries use raw materials containing significant levels of natural radionuclides; the processing of these materials can expose workers and people living near such sites to radiation levels well above the natural background. This radioactivity is due to nuclides belonging to the 238U and 232Th decay chains and to 40K. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and gamma-ray spectrometry have been used together to determine uranium and thorium concentration and the conditions of secular equilibrium in their decay chains for samples from ceramic and phosphate-fertiliser plants. In fact, the knowledge of the secular equilibrium conditions is necessary in order to make correct assumptions for the dose assessment. The results indicate that the secular equilibrium is verified for the samples from ceramic plants, whereas a situation of disequilibrium between parents and daughters of the natural chains is detected in phosphate fertilisers. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {This paper argues why and how migration should be conceptualised as an intrinsic part of broader processes of development and social change instead of as the antithesis of development, as dominant discourses hold. When societies go through the various economic, cultural, technological, political and demographic transitions associated with ‘development', this leads to increasing levels of internal and international out-migration. Low-income societies generally have lower emigration levels because poverty tends to constrain people's movements. Development leads to more instead of less migration because it increases people's capabilities and aspirations to move. The paradox of development-driven emigration hikes shows the inability of conventional push–pull and neoclassical models to explain migration as well as the need for a new vision of migration as part of broader development. Migration is shaped by development in both origin and destination societies and also contributes to further change in its own right. However, the embeddedness of migration in broader processes of social transformation and development also means that its potential to affect structural change is fundamentally limited. This shows the logical fallacy of narratives that cast development as a ‘solution' for perceived migration problems or that cast migration and remittances as panaceas with which to solve fundamental development problems.},

abstract = {Radon and radon progeny are present indoors, in houses and others dwellings, representing the most important contribution to dose from natural sources of radiation. Most studies have demonstrated an increased risk of lung cancer at high concentration of radon for both smokers and nonsmokers. The work presents a comparative analysis of the radon exposure data in the two radon-prone areas, Stei, Transylvania, (Romania), in the near of old Romanian uranium mines and in the granitic area of Torrelodones town, Sierra de Guadarrama (Spain). Measurements of indoor radon were performed in 280 dwellings (Romania) and 91 dwellings (Spain) by using nuclear track detectors, CR 39. The highest value measured in Stei area was 2650 Bq m(-3) and 366 Bq m(-3) in the Spanish region. The results are computed with the BEIR VI report estimates using the age-duration model at an exposure rate below 2650 Bq m(-3). We used the EC Radon Software to calculate the lifetime lung cancer death risks for individuals groups in function of attained age, radon exposures and tobacco consumption. A total of 233 lung cancer deaths were observed in the Stei area for a period of 13 years (1994-2006), which is 116.82{\%} higher than expected from the national statistics. In addition, the number of deaths estimated for the year 2005 is 28, which is worth more than 2.21 times the amount expected by authorities. In comparison, for Torrelodones was rated a number of 276 deaths caused by lung cancer for a period of 13 years, which is 2.09 times higher than the number expected by authorities. For the year 2005 in the Spanish region were reported 32 deaths caused by pulmonary cancer, the number of deaths exceeding seen again with a factor of 2.10 statistical expectations. This represents a significantly evidence that elevated risk can strongly be associated with cumulated radon exposure.},

abstract = {Source delineation of hydrocarbon contaminated sites is of high importance for remediation work. However, traditional methods like soil core extraction and analysis or recent Membrane Interface Probe methods are time consuming and costly. Therefore, the development of an in situ method based on soil gas analysis can be interesting. This includes the direct measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil gas taken from gas probes using a PID (Photo Ionization Detector) and the analysis of other soil gases related to VOC degradation distribution (CH4, O2, CO2) or related to presence of Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (LNAPL) as 222Rn. However, in widespread heterogeneous formations, delineation by gas measurements becomes more challenging. The objective of this study is twofold: (i) to analyse the potential of several in situ gas measurement techniques in comparison to soil coring for LNAPL source delineation at a heterogeneous contaminated site where the techniques might be limited by a low diffusion potential linked to the presence of fine sands and silts, and (ii) to analyse the effect of vertical sediment heterogeneities on the performance of these gas measurement methods. Thus, five types of gases were analysed: VOCs, their three related degradation products O2, CO2 and CH4 and 222Rn. Gas measurements were compared to independent LNAPL analysis by coring. This work was conducted at an old industrial site frequently contaminated by a Diesel-Fuel mixture located in a heterogeneous fine-grained aquifer. Results show that in such heterogeneous media migration of reactive gases like VOCs occurs only across small distances and the VOC concentrations sampled with gas probes are mainly related to local conditions rather than the presence of LNAPL below the gas probe. 222Rn is not well correlated with LNAPL because of sediment heterogeneity. Oxygen, CO2, and especially CH4, have larger lengths of diffusion and give the clearest picture for LNAPL presence at this site even when the gas probe is somewhat distant.},

abstract = {The naturally radioactive but chemically inert gas, radon, is formed from the radioactive decay of radium which is part of the uranium series. Radon gas, which has a half life of 3.8 days, must escape from soil particles through air-filled pores in order to enter the atmosphere following the decay of radium. The concentration of radon in the atmosphere varies, depending on the place, time, height above the ground and meteorological conditions. It is thus an inescapable source of radiation exposure, both at home and at work. The potential hazards posed by exposure to radiation from indoor radon gas and its daughter products are of great concern worldwide. Noting of an excessive lung cancer risk among several groups of underground miners exposed to radon and its daughter products, studies on radon concentrations in the workplace and in dwellings have been conducted in many countries. The results have shown that the distribution of radon concentrations are approximately lognormal from which population weighted; the arithmetic mean of radon concentration of 40 Bq.m-3 has been adopted worldwide for dwellings and workplaces. The principal methods for reducing a high indoor radon concentration are: reducing the radon supply by reversing the pressure difference between the building and the soil; raising the resistance of the foundations to soil gas entry; removing the radon sources such as water or underlying soil; diluting the concentration by increasing the ventilation rate; and reducing the concentration of radon progeny by filtering and increasing the circulation of indoor air. Buildings which have a radon concentration higher than 200 Bq.m-3 should be investigated by the national authorities concerned; meanwhile, householders should be advised to take simple temporary precautions, such as increasing ventilation, until a permanent remedy can be effected.},

@article{Leuning2008,
abstract = {The paper describes various techniques for measuring emissions to the atmosphere from geologically stored carbon dioxide, from point, line and area sources at scales of metres to several kilometres. Flux chambers are suitable for measuring small leakage rates from sources at known locations but many samples are required because of large spatial heterogeneity in the fluxes. Micrometeorological eddy covariance, relaxed eddy accumulation and flux-gradient techniques are suitable for measuring leakage from large area sources, while integrated horizontal mass balance, tracer methods and plume dispersion approaches are applicable for line and point sources. Distinguishing between leakage signals and natural fluctuations in CO2 concentrations due to biogenic sources pose significant challenges and the use of naturally occurring tracers such as CO2 isotopologues or introduced tracers such as SF6 added to the sequestered CO2 will assist with this problem. Forward Lagrangian dispersion calculations showed that CO2 concentrations 0-80 m downwind of a point source would be readily detectable above all natural variations for point sources {\textgreater}0.3 g CO2 s-1 (about 10 tonnes of CO2 per year). The inverse problem involves solving for the unknown emission rate from measured wind fields and down wind concentration perturbations. An optimum monitoring strategy for inverse analysis will require continuous measurements of CO2 and tracer compounds upwind and downwind of the possible leak location, coupled with transport modelling to determine leakage fluxes, and to differentiate them from other sources. Computations using The air pollution model (TAPM) showed that expected perturbations in CO2 concentrations at distances of several hundred metres from a leak of 32 g CO2 s-1 (about 1000 tonnes CO2 per year, or about 0.01{\%} per year of a typical amount to be stored) will be detectable, but this anomaly will be very small compared to natural variations, thereby complicating the inverse analysis. While the techniques canvassed here have proven successful for measuring fluxes in other applications, none has yet been demonstrated for geosequestration. The next step is to test them in the field.

abstract = {More than 244 million international migrants were estimated to live in a foreign country in 2015, leaving apart the massive number of people that have been relocated in their own country. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of international migrants from southern countries do not reach western nations but resettle in neighbouring low-income countries in the same geographical area. Migration is a complex phenomenon, where 'macro'-, 'meso'- and 'micro'-factors act together to inform the final individual decision to migrate, integrating the simpler previous push-pull theory.Among the 'macro-factors', the political, demographic, socio-economic and environmental situations are major contributors to migration. These are the main drivers of forced migration, either international or internal, and largely out of individuals' control.Among the 'meso-factors', communication technology, land grabbing and diasporic links play an important role. In particular, social media attract people out of their origin countries by raising awareness of living conditions in the affluent world, albeit often grossly exaggerated, with the diaspora link also acting as an attractor. However, 'micro-factors' such as education, religion, marital status and personal attitude to migration also have a key role in making the final decision to migrate an individual choice. The stereotype of the illiterate, poor and rural migrant reaching the borders of affluent countries has to be abandoned. The poorest people simply do not have the means to escape war and poverty and remain trapped in their country or in the neighbouring one.Once in the destination country, migrants have to undergo a difficult and often conflictive integration process in the hosting community. From the health standpoint, newly arrived migrants are mostly healthy (healthy migrant effect), but they may harbour latent infections that need appropriate screening policies. Cultural barriers may sometimes hamper the relation between the migrant patient and the health care provider. The acquisition of western lifestyles is leading to an increase of non-communicable chronic diseases that require attention.Destination countries have to reconsider the positive medium/long-term potential of migration and need to be prepared to receive migrants for the benefit of the migrants themselves and their native population.},

Two pilot sites are also currently in the project portfolio, Ketzin in Germany and K12-B in the offshore continental shelf of the Netherlands. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {National and regional radon surveys are used in many nations to produce maps detailing the spatial variation of indoor radon concentrations. National surveys which are designed to be representative use either a geographically-weighted or a population-weighted sampling scheme. Additionally, many countries collect a large number of data on indoor radon concentrations from volunteers who have chosen to have the indoor radon concentration measured in their own dwellings. This work examines the representativeness of volunteer-based samples in radon measurement and explores the effect of potential volunteer bias on radon mapping results. We also investigate the influence that media attention has on volunteer sampling of indoor radon concentrations. The result of our work indicates that volunteer measurements are biased due to over-sampling of high radon areas. Consequently such volunteer radon measurements should not be used for radon mapping purposes.},

abstract = {Radon is a natural radioactive gas and it is currently accepted as being responsible for lung cancer in some cases. One of the most important sources of indoor radon is from the soil. The radium content of soil is also a very important factor to be taken into account. The natural radiation map of Spain (MARNA) classifies the country into three regions with different levels of natural gamma radiation. There are some areas in Spain with high levels of natural radiation one of those is the province of Salamanca. Western part of this province presents a population of 20 000 inhabitants and 7{\%} of the houses have an indoor radon concentration above 400 Bq{\&}middot;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. In this high risk area, the village of Villar de la Yegua is of special interest: 11{\%} of the houses in this village have an indoor radon level below 400 Bq{\&}middot;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, 89{\%} have above 400 Bq{\&}middot;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and 71{\%} of the houses have a radon concentration above 1000 Bq{\&}middot;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. An old uranium mine site close to this village has been selected for the construction of an experimental pilot house. It is a two story house located in the place with a very high {\textless}sup{\textgreater}226{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Ra concentration in soil. Radon in soil at 1 m depth has an average level of 250 kBq{\&}middot;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. We present in this work the characteristics of the experimental unit located in this high risk area and we describe the zone where one of the Spanish villages with the highest radon concentration is located. This is a very interesting place for further research on indoor radon concentration and it is a unique opportunity of testing radon monitors, radon passive detectors and remedial actions for the mitigation of radon in real conditions. It is common to carry out intercomparison exercises under laboratory conditions. Nonetheless, it is not so common to develop these exercises in real conditions as we have in the experimental unit we present here. We offer in this work the possibility for other research groups of testing their equipments in this unit and we also show the evolution of the works carried out in the locality of Villar de la Yegua.},

Robust geostatistical methods were applied for identifying possible spatial outliers of Cu and Pb data, and then a sequential Gaussian simulation was employed for delineating the potential areas where Cu or Pb concentration was affected by diffuse pollution. The results showed that the spatial outliers of Cu and Pb were strongly associated with various types of factories. The anthropogenic input of Cu to soils at local hotspots was closely related to emissions of printing and dyeing, metallurgical, and chemical factories, whereas a lead oxide factory and a chemical factory resulted in a considerable increase of Pb in the topsoil of the study area. Approximately 30{\%} of the total land area of the study was at potential risk from the Cu or Pb diffuse pollution resulting from rapid industrialization of the area over the past 20 years},

However, in the calculation of radon dose to the lung, the radon equilibrium equivalent concentration is used. The measured equilibrium factor times the measured radon gas concentration estimates the equilibrium equivalent concentration. Therefore, the equilibrium factor is an important factor in radon dose calculations. A review of published measurements of equilibrium factors shows a range of values reported in studies from more than 20 countries, measured in indoor residential, indoor public, and outdoor environments. Values for Rn are reported and discussed here, with special attention paid to results from India and China, where measured equilibrium factors are reported for hundreds and thousands of households, respectively. The wide range of equilibrium factors suggests that location-specific values are more appropriate than a worldwide average value in the calculation of lung bronchial dose.},

It shows that the effects of international migration of labour on the wage inequity crucially depend on both the relative capital intensities between the low-skill and high-skill sectors and the institutional nature of the markets for unskilled labour. The analysis finds that an emigration (immigration) of either type of labour is likely to produce a favourable (an unfavourable) effect on the wage inequality. In particular, the result of emigration (immigration) of skilled labour on the relative wage inequality is counterintuitive.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {103 gas samples collected at 7 different Italian landfills have analyzed to define their chemical (CO2, CH4, N2 and O2+Ar,) and isotopic (??13CCO2, ??13CCH4, ??2HCH4) composition. Chemical analysis was carried out by means of gas chromatography (Thermal Conductivity Detector - TCD and Flame Ionization Detector - FID), while isotopic parameters were analyzed by means of gas mass spectrometry. The N2/(O2+Ar) and CH4/CO2 ratios have been utilized in order to obtain a primary classification of the samples. Following this approach, 7 groups, corresponding to different redox conditions and various degrees of interaction with air, have been individuated. This classification has been compared with isotopic indications. Isotopic contents (??13CCO2 and ??13CCH4) have been processed to investigate fermentation processes by means of statistical data processing of fractionation factor (??), consisting in partitioning technique. This approach leads to a new definition of the fractionation factor (??) limits that define the domains of existence of major fermentation processes. These limits correspond to the maximum value expected for CO2 absorption and/or CH4 massive oxidation processes (??=1.049), and to the minimum fractionation factor expected for CO2 biological reduction pathway (??=1.067).Obtained results indicate that it is possible to assume which fermentation processes take place in LFG generation by combining information derived from the interpretation of chemical and isotopic data. Anyway, it is worth to note that the complexity of LFG generation processes, involving several matrices and a multitude of microbial associations, cannot be unwisely investigated just by chemical analysis or by a single isotopic parameter. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The effect of soil moisture on seasonal variation in soil air and indoor radon is studied. A brief review of the theory of the effect of soil moisture on soil air radon has been presented. The theoretical estimates, together with soil moisture measurements over a period of 10 y, indicate that variation in soil moisture evidently is an important factor affecting the seasonal variation in soil air radon concentration. Partitioning of radon gas between the water and air fractions of soil pores is the main factor increasing soil air radon concentration. On two example test sites, the relative standard deviation of the calculated monthly average soil air radon concentration was 17 and 26 {\%}. Increased soil moisture in autumn and spring, after the snowmelt, increases soil gas radon concentrations by 10-20 {\%}. In February and March, the soil gas radon concentration is in its minimum. Soil temperature is also an important factor. High soil temperature in summer increased the calculated soil gas radon concentration by 14 {\%}, compared with winter values. The monthly indoor radon measurements over period of 1 y in 326 Finnish houses are presented and compared with the modelling results. The model takes into account radon entry, climate and air exchange. The measured radon concentrations in autumn and spring were higher than expected and it can be explained by the seasonal variation in the soil moisture. The variation in soil moisture is a potential factor affecting markedly to the high year-to-year variation in the annual or seasonal average radon concentrations, observed in many radon studies.},

abstract = {Experimental data obtained from uranium dioxide solubility studies as a function of pH and under nominally reducing conditions in a 0.008 mol dm−3 perchlorate medium and in a 1 mol dm−3 chloride solution are presented. The solubility of extensively characterized uraninite samples from Cigar Lake (Canada), Jachymov (Czech Republic), and Oklo (Gabon) was determined in a solution matching the composition of a groundwater associated with granitic terrain. The redox potential of the test solution was monitored throughout the experimental period. The results obtained were modeled using aqueous formation constants compiled by the NEA, using stability constants corrected to appropriate ionic strengths. The solubility curves have been adjusted by calculating the value of Ks4 (UO2(s) + 2H2O ⇔ U(OH)4(aq)) that gave the best fit with the experimental data. For a low temperature synthetic UO2, a value of logKs4 of −7.3 was determined, while for uraninites the best fit was obtained with a value of logKs4 of −8.5. A wide range of published UO2 solubilities can be reproduced by the available database, where experimental conditions were adequately defined in the original experiments. A lower value of the solubility product of the uranium dioxide phase defined as fuel in the SKB uranium database provides reasonable solubilities for a wide span of experimental results at near to neutral pH. Based on the modeling and using the $\beta$1,4 for the U(IV)-OH complexation given by Grenthe et al. (1992a), a logKs0 (UO2(s) + 4H+ ⇔ U4+ + 2H2O) value of −2.3 ± 0.2 is proposed. Differences in solubility between natural and synthetic samples are attributed to the presence of carbonate in the experiments performed with uraninites, while differences in solubility observed among the natural samples can be correlated to radiation effects at atomic scale.},

abstract = {There exist many secondary data that must be considered in in reservoir characterization for resource assessment and performance forecasting. These include multiple seismic attributes, geological trends and structural controls. It is essential that all secondary data be accounted for with the precision warranted by that data type. Cokriging is the standard technique in geostatistics to account for multiple data types. The most common variant of cokriging in petroleum geostatistics is collocated cokriging. Implementations of collocated cokriging are often limited to a single sec- ondary variable. Practitioners often choose the most correlated or most relevant sec- ondary variable. Improved models would be constructed if multiple variables were accounted for simultaneously. This paper presents a novel approach to (1) merge all secondary data into a single super secondary variable, then (2) implement collocated cokriging with the single variable. The preprocessing step is straightforward and no major changes are required in the standard implementation of collocated cokriging. The theoretical validity of this approach is proven, that is, the results are proven to be identical to a “full” approach using all multiple secondary variables simultaneously.

abstract = {? The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2015.Compositional data constitutes a special class of quantitative measurements involving parts of a whole. The sample space has an algebraic-geometric structure different from that of real-valued data. A subcomposition is a subset of all possible parts. When compositional data values include geographical locations, they are also regionalized variables. In the Earth sciences, geochemical analyses are a common form of regionalized compositional data. Ordinarily, there are measurements only at data locations. Geostatistics has proven to be the standard for spatial estimation of regionalized variables but, in general, the compositional character of the geochemical data has been ignored. This paper presents in detail an application of cokriging for the modelling of compositional data using a method that is consistent with the compositional character of the data. The uncertainty is evaluated by a Monte Carlo procedure. The method is illustrated for the contents of arsenic and iron in groundwaters in Bangladesh, which have the peculiarity of being measured in milligrams per litre, units for which the sum of all parts does not add to a constant. Practical results include maps of estimates of the geochemical elements in the original concentration units, as well as measures of uncertainty, such as the probability that the concentration may exceed a given threshold. Results indicate that probabilities of exceedance in previous studies of the same data are too low.},

In this work we have taken into account major, minor and trace element data and clay, silt, sand and organic matter contents of ophiolitic soils collected from several places in Tuscany (Central Italy) where the chemical nature of the bedrocks is known. Thus, using data belonging to three groups of soils collected on serpentinitic, gabbroic and basaltic bedrocks we have studied the influence of the bedrock on the chemical character of the soils. We have applied discriminant analysis techniques to find a 'classification rule' both to discriminate the groups originally determined and to assign new samples to one of these groups. Furthermore, starling from a large number of variables defining the overall chemical character of soil samples, we have found that truly a few variables contribute to discriminate the three groups.},

abstract = {Detection and quantification of different gas species in the vadose zone of soils and/or in the atmospheric boundary layer is a key method in many fields of environmental research and also considered as one element of monitoring related to carbon storage operations. We have developed a robust and economic continuous soil gas monitoring system, which requires little maintenance and includes an automatic data transfer. We report on one of the largest continuous baseline data sets ever recorded. They were acquired during a long-term (up to 4 years) continuous soil gas monitoring program completed during a case study in the Altmark area (Germany). Permanent monitoring stations were operated at 12 well sites and one reference location.We detected considerable and site specific variations of CO2 concentration at shallow depths (1-3m), which show that soil gas baseline concentrations, including quantification of variations caused by natural influences, can only be performed by means of a long-term continuous monitoring with reasonably short measuring intervals. The major result from the analysis of the data set is that much of the complexity of soil gas monitoring can be avoided if the correct sites and depths are chosen. In particular, we can demonstrate that CO2 concentrations are very stable over long time periods (more than one year) when measured below the biological active soil zone (here at 0.5m depth in average) and above the water table, where they are marginally touched by atmospheric influences. Seasonal variations trend to level out providing a constant signal over longer time periods (weeks/months).Applying a simplified non-steady state 1D-diffusion leakage model to the data set reveals that CO2 concentration is quite sensitive to additional leakage in this stable zone, both in terms of concentration increase and response time. Monitoring in deeper parts of the soil column is much more sensitive to additional seepage than surface emission measurements. For the study site, we have developed criteria for rating the effectiveness of the monitoring locations based on absolute and variability of the carbon dioxide concentration, the local water level fluctuations and estimated seepage rates. The evaluation of ??13C isotopic composition of background CO2 at deeper measuring intervals shows that ??13C can discriminate leakage even when isotopic composition of injected CO2 is similar to soil CO2. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The applicability of radon (222 Rn) measurements to delineate non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL) contamination in subsoil is discussed at a site with lithological discontinuities through a blind test. Three alpha spectroscopy monitors were used to measure radon in soil air in a 25,000-m 2 area, following a regular sampling design with a 20-m 2 grid. Repeatability and reproducibility of the results were assessed by means of duplicate measurements in six sampling positions. Furthermore, three points not affected by oil spills were sampled to estimate radon background concentration in soil air. Data histograms, Q-Q plots, variograms, and cluster analysis allowed to recognize two data populations, associated with the possible path of a fault and a lithological discontinuity. Even though the concentration of radon in soil air was dominated by this discontinuity, the characterization of the background emanation in each lithological unit allowed to distinguish areas potentially affected by NAPL, thus justifying the application of radon emanometry as a screening technique for the delineation of NAPL plumes in sites with lithological discontinuities.},

abstract = {Borewater monitoring near the Ranger U mine tailings dam has revealed deterioration in water quality in several bores since 1981, with increases in sulphate concentrations of up to 1000 times being observed. In some cases, significant increases in 226Ra concentrations also occurred. In this study, isotopes of Ra, Th and Ac were measured in borewater in 1988–1993. For the most seepage-affected bores, the concentrations of 223Ra, 224Ra and 228Ra as well as the nuclidic ratios 228Ra/226Ra, 223Ra/226Ra and 224Ra/228Ra generally increased. Time-series concentration increases were observed for Sr but not for Ba. 227Ac concentrations increased with time, but not sufficiently to account for the increasing 223Ra concentrations. It is concluded that increases observed in Ra isotope concentrations arise from competition for cation adsorption sites in the vicinity of the bore rather than by direct transport of Ra from the tailings. Formation of a barite solid phase is occurring in the groundwater and causing the removal of some Ra from solution, with rapid replenishment of the shorter-lived isotopes from their parents.},

abstract = {Since October 2001, four soil CO2 flux stations were installed in the island of S??o Miguel (Azores archipelago), at Fogo and Furnas quiescent central volcanoes. These stations perform measurements by the accumulation chamber method and, as the gas flux may be influenced by external variables, the stations are equipped with several meteorological sensors. Multivariate regression analysis applied to the large datasets obtained allowed observing that the meteorological variables may influence the soil CO2 flux oscillations from 18{\%} to 50.5{\%} at the different monitoring sites. Additionally, it was observed that meteorological variables (mainly soil water content, barometric pressure, wind speed and rainfall) play a different role in the control of the gas flux, depending on the selected monitoring site and may cause significant short-term (spike-like) fluctuations. These divergences may be potentially explained by the porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the soils, topographic effects, drainage area and different exposure of the monitoring sites to the weather conditions. Seasonal effects are responsible for long-term oscillations on the gas flux. Before a reliable application of soil CO2 flux to seismic and/or volcanic monitoring, it is important to recognize those environmental influences on the gas flux. In addition, understanding the external meteorological influences on the gas flux may be important for the public health risk assessment, since meteorological parameters may cause also significant indoor CO2 increases. In a house at Furnas Village (in Furnas volcano caldera), the values detected reached percentages as high as 20.8{\%} due to significant decreases in the barometric pressure. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Background: Radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer worldwide. Most indoor exposure occurs by diffusion of soil gas. Radon is also found in well water, natural gas and ambient air. Pennsylvania has high indoor radon concentrations; buildings are often tested during real estate transactions with results reported to the Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). Objectives: To evaluate predictors of indoor radon concentrations. Methods: Using first floor and basement indoor radon results reported to the PADEP between 1987-2013, we evaluated associations of radon concentrations (ln-transformed) with geology, water source, building characteristics, season, weather, community socioeconomic status, community type and unconventional natural gas development measures based on drilled and producing wells. Results: Primary analysis included 866,735 first measurements by building, the large majority from homes. The geologic rock layer on which the building sat was strongly associated with radon concentration (e.g., Axemann Formation, median = 365 Bq/m3, IQR = 167-679 vs. Stockton Formation, median = 93 Bq/m3, IQR = 52-178). In adjusted analysis, buildings using well water had 21{\%} higher concentrations ($\beta$ = 0.191, 95{\%} CI: 0.184, 0.198). Buildings in cities (vs. townships) had lower concentrations ($\beta$ = -0.323, 95{\%} CI: -0.333, -0.314). When we included multiple tests per building, concentrations declined with repeated measurements over time. Between 2005-2013, 7469 unconventional wells were drilled in Pennsylvania. Basement radon concentrations fluctuated between 1987-2003, but began an upward trend from 2004-2012 in all county categories (p {\textless} 0.001), higher levels in counties with ≥100 drilled wells vs. counties with none, and with highest levels in the Reading Prong. Conclusions: Geologic unit, well water, community, weather and unconventional natural gas development were associated with indoor radon concentrations. Future studies should include direct environmental measurement of radon, and building features unavailable for this analysis.},

A mathematical analysis of the accumulation of CO2 in the chamber in terms of diffusion and advection (e.g., air flow out of the ground at geothermal degassing locations) shows that the same protocol should be followed, whether the mechanism of emission is purely by diffusion or by a combination of diffusion and advection. The analysis also yields a simple way for estimating soil CO2 conductance and the soil CO2 concentration at the depth of insertion of the chamber into the ground. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In keeping with the global efforts on inventorisation of methane emission, municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are recognised as one of the major sources of anthropogenic emissions generated from human activities. In India, most of the solid wastes are disposed of by landfilling in low-lying areas located in and around the urban centres resulting in generation of large quantities of biogas containing a sizeable proportion of methane. After a critical review of literature on the methodology for estimation of methane emissions, the default methodology has been used in estimation following the IPCC guidelines 1996. However, as the default methodology assumes that all potential methane is emitted in the year of waste deposition, a triangular model for biogas from landfill has been proposed and the results are compared. The methodology proposed for methane emissions from landfills based on a triangular model is more realistic and can very well be used in estimation on global basis. Methane emissions from MSW landfills for the year AD 1980-1999 have been estimated which could be used in computing national inventories of methane emission. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Residential radon exposure is a serious public health concern, and as such appears in the recommendations of European Code Against Cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the association between residential radon levels and mortality due to different types of cancer, using misaligned data analysis techniques. Mortality data (observed cases) for each of the 313 Galician municipalities were drawn from the records of the National Statistics Institute for the study period (1999–2008). Expected cases were computed using Galician mortality rates for 14 types of malignant tumors as reference, with a total of 56,385 deaths due to the tumors analyzed. The effect estimates of indoor radon (3371 sampling points) were adjusted for sociodemographic variables, altitude, and arsenic topsoil levels (1069 sampling points), using spatial/geostatistical models fitted with stochastic partial differential equations and integrated nested Laplace approximations. These models are capable of processing misaligned data. The results showed a statistical association between indoor radon and lung, stomach and brain cancer in women in Galicia. Apart from lung cancer (relative risk (RR) = 1.09), in which a twofold increase in radon exposure led to a 9{\%} rise in mortality, the association was particularly relevant in stomach (RR = 1.17) and brain cancer (RR = 1.28). Further analytical epidemiologic studies are needed to confirm these results, and an assessment should be made of the advisability of implementing interventions targeting such exposure in higher-risk areas.},

Thermal waters were surveyed from the seismically active area of Poso{\v{c}}je (Bled and Zatolmin; NW Slovenia) and from Roga{\v{s}}ka Slatina in eastern Slovenia. Continuous monitoring of geochemical parameters (radon concentration, electrical conductivity, and water temperature) was performed with discrete gas sampling for their 3He/ 4He ratio. The observed values were correlated with meteorological parameters (rainfall, barometric pressure and air temperature) and with seismic activity. Only a few earthquakes occurred in the vicinity of the measuring sites during the monitoring period. Nevertheless, changes in radon concentration, water temperature, electrical conductivity and helium isotopic ratio were detected at the three thermal springs in the periods preceding the earthquakes. A close correlation was also observed of both water temperature and electrical conductivity with the Earth tide, making the observations in the selected sites a promising tool for addressing the widely debated question of earthquake prediction. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The reactive behavior of supercritical CO2 under conditions relevant to geologic storage and sequestration of C is largely unknown. Experiments were conducted in a flexible cell hydrothermal apparatus to determine the extent of fluid - rock reactions, in addition to carbonate mineral precipitation, that may occur in a brine aquifer - aquitard system that simulates a saline aquifer storage scenario. The system was held at 200??C and 200 bars for 59 days (1413 h) to approach steady state, then injected with CO2 and allowed to react for another 80 days (1924 h). In addition to magnesite precipitation, silicate minerals (quartz, plagioclase, microcline and biotite) in the aquifer and the aquitard display textures (etch pits, mineralization) indicating significant reaction. Changes in elemental abundances in the brine following addition of CO2 include pH decrease and enrichment in Cl-, partly due to supercritical CO2 desiccation of the brine. Geologic sequestration systems have potential for geochemical reactions that extend beyond simple aqueous dissolution of CO2 and precipitation of carbonate. These reactions may produce geochemical and geotechnical consequences for sequestration and provide important characteristics for monitoring and evaluation of stored CO2. An understanding of multi-phase equilibrium relationships between supercritical CO2 and aquifer - brine systems also raises new questions for a variety of geologic systems. Multi-phase fluid equilibria may, for example, account for the large amounts and heterogeneous distributions of calcite cement in a wide variety of geologic systems, particularly in sedimentary basin sandstones.},

A computational method is derived for the determination of the residual water content and for the extrapolation of the water content‐capillary head curve as measured in a limited range. The proposed model is compared with the existing practical models of Averjanov (1950), Wyllie and Gardner (1958), and Millington and Quirk (1961) on the basis of the measured data of 45 soils.

abstract = {The geochemical study carried out on seven natural gas emissions from Sardinia island (western-central Italy) has allowed to distinguish two different groups: i) CO2-high and He-low gases in the Logudoro area (northern Sardinia) associated with low temperature Na-HCO3 type waters and ii) N2 and He-rich gases bordering the western limit of Paleozoic basement crystalline rocks associated with long-term Na-Cl and Na(Ca)-Cl thermal water circulation therein. The emission of CO2 is prevalently related to outcrop areas of recent Quaternary extensional basaltic volcanism. The different origin of the two types of gas is even more evident when considering the helium (as R/Ra) and argon isotopic ratios for the Logudoro and the remaining areas, being 3.0-3.5 Ra and {\textgreater}320 and {\textless}0.4 Ra and 295, respectively. Both CO2 and such isotopic ratios suggest: i) a deep source for the Logudoro samples where a contribution of 40-50{\%} mantle gas can be assessed; ii) a prevalent atmospheric origin for the N2-rich gases emerging in association with meteoric-derived thermal waters circulating in aquifers reaching 2, 000 m in depth and 80°-110°C maximum temperature inside the Paleozoic formations. Although both the N2/Ar and 40Ar/36Ar ratios in the N2-rich gases point, roughly, to an atmospheric origin, their relative Ne concentration, being this element almost exclusively of atmospheric origin, suggests that contributions of N2 from other sources than air can be envisaged.},

At the soil level, the monitoring of potential CO2 leakage will be requested, at least for high hazard areas (wells, faults). In this study, we compared the performance of a soil gas baseline survey with the disturbance in the gas composition and flux expected for a low amplitude diffuse leakage of CO2. A numerical study of a CO2 leakage was performed at the vadose scale by creating an underground CO2 source and observing its migration toward the atmosphere across a natural limestone formation. Only CO2 molecular diffusion in the gas phase and CO2 dissolution in the irreducible water were taken into account in this numerical model, following the description of a natural site on which field work was performed. A gas geochemistry baseline was performed in key locations and determined from the numerical predictions of the CO2 plume extension. In the light of the numerical experiment, we show how the different soil gas parameters measured are potentially useful for the detection of diffuse CO2 leaks at the soil level and we present the panel of different analyses and their respective addition to such studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Geochemical analyses of bedrock, groundwater and sediments and comparisons between indoor radon values and soil radon values indicate that the indoor radon concentrations in this area are strongly affected by subterranean airflows caused by temperature differences between soil air and atmospheric air. The airflows concentrate the radon-laden soil air towards the topographic highest part of the deposit in winter and towards the topographic lowest part in summer. In areas where subterranean airflows are likely to occur, radon measurements performed both in summer and in winter provide the best estimate of annual average indoor radon concentrations, and assessments of indoor radon concentrations based on single soil gas measurements are not recommended.},

                        2 is removed from produced natural gas and re-injected below the gas-water contact on the flanks of the reservoir. The biological work was the first such study undertaken at the site. Observations were made in: uplifted areas around the three CO
                        2 injection wells, around the KB-5 well where breakthrough of CO
                        2 from the KB-502 injector had occurred, around the KB-4 well and in a background area away from CO
                        2 injection and gas production. Near ground atmospheric measurements were made with a mobile open path laser system, with soil gas and flux measurements in support of these and of a botanical and microbiological survey. Longer term monitoring was initiated for radon and other gases using buried probes and activated charcoal integrative collectors. Laser measurements appeared to show only natural variations, but interference from the vehicle exhaust, windblown dust and rain was apparent. Modifications are needed to overcome these problems. Natural variation of atmospheric CO
                        2 needs to be better constrained to identify anomalous values. Soil gas concentrations and fluxes were very low but slightly higher values over the KB-5 well could indicate low-level leakage. This is likely to be a legacy of breakthrough prior to the abandonment of the well. A variety of monocotyledonous and dicotyledenous plants was present, particularly in dry wadis or shallow depressions. The xerophytic flora and the microbial numbers were typical of such desert environments and the data provide baseline values since there were no indications of elevated CO
                        2. There were analytical problems with the microbial activity determinations but it can be concluded that activities were low. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Published solubility data for gypsum, anhydrite, celestite, barite and RaSO4 were first reevaluated, in most cases using the ion interaction approach of Pitzer, to determine solubility products of the sulfates as a function of temperature and pressure. Ionic strengths of the brines were from 2.9 to 4.8 m, their temperatures and pressures up to 40°C and 130 bars. Saturation indices of the sulfates were computed with the ion-interaction approach in one brine from the arkosic granite wash fades and four from the carbonate Wolfcamp Formation. All five brines are saturated with respect to gypsum, anhydrite and celestite, and three of the five with respect to barite. All are undersaturated by from 5 to 6 orders of magnitude with respect to pure RaSO4. 226Ra concentrations in the brines, which ranged from 10−11.3 to 10−12.7 m, are not controlled by RaSO4 solubility or adsorption, but possibly by the solubility of trace Ra solid solutions in sulfates including celestite and barite.},

abstract = {Earth degassing specifically of carbon dioxide CO2 is of increasing interest with respect to the global carbon budget, related climate effects, earthquake and volcano eruption mechanisms, as well as plant physiological reactions in gas-rich environments. Investigations in all of these disciplines require the detection of surface CO2 degassing structures and quantification of their emissions. We introduce minimal thermal change detection based on infrared imaging as a new remote sensing tool for the detection of earth surface thermal anomalies suiting among others to discover earth degassing locations of any origin. The method allows for seamless areal search and monitoring of degassing structures in any terrain. As proof of concept infrared imaging measurements were performed at the Bossoleto vent on the eastern master fault of the Siena Graben (Tuscany, Italy). It is known for the migration of a large amount of CO2-rich gas from deep geothermal reservoirs. Field data acquired confirmed the qualification of the method. Detection of CO2 degassing locations from infrared image time series worked reliably and optimal detection conditions were identified (dry, calm, cloudless weather between dusk and dawn). A simple model of heat exchange processes involved and observed was developed. In a first attempt this model was applied to determine the gas exit temperature, the area of gas thermal reach and the gas flux from recorded image series. It is the first method that allows remote areal survey of mofette fields and the associated CO2 flux quantification sole from infrared image time series. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can help nations meet their Paris CO2 reduction commitments cost-effectively. However, lack of confidence in geologic CO2 storage security remains a barrier to CCS implementation. Here we present a numerical program that calculates CO2 storage security and leakage to the atmosphere over 10,000 years. This combines quantitative estimates of geological subsurface CO2 retention, and of surface CO2 leakage. We calculate that realistically well-regulated storage in regions with moderate well densities has a 50{\%} probability that leakage remains below 0.0008{\%} per year, with over 98{\%} of the injected CO2 retained in the subsurface over 10,000 years. An unrealistic scenario, where CO2 storage is inadequately regulated, estimates that more than 78{\%} will be retained over 10,000 years. Our modelling results suggest that geological storage of CO2 can be a secure climate change mitigation option, but we note that long-term behaviour of CO2 in the subsurface remains a key uncertainty.},

In all selected study areas in sub-Arctic oceanic Eastern Iceland, Arctic-oceanic Swedish Lapland and sub-Arctic oceanic Finnish Lapland the intensity of contemporary denudative processes and mass transfers is altogether rather low. The direct comparison of the annual mass transfers occurring within the four investigated drainage basins summarises that there are differences between process inten- sities and the relative importance of different denudative processes within the study areas in Eastern Iceland, Swedish Lapland and Finnish Lapland. The major controls of these detected differences are (i) climate, (ii) lithology, (iii) relief and (iv) vegetation cover. The applied drainage basin – based approach seems to be effective for analysing the sediment budget and trends of Postglacial relief development in selected study areas with given environmental set- tings. Direct comparisons of investigated drainage basins will improve the possibilities to model relief development as well as possible effects of projected climate change in cold envi- ronments.},

The report provides an overview of current emission trends and progress towards targets as well as policy developments that took place over the period from Background: Spain has put much emphasis on the transition to a green economy. However, the Spanish climate policy was mainly based on the promotion of renewable electricity generation via a feed-in tariff scheme. This cornerstone of climate policy has effectively been abandoned with Royal Decree Law (RDL) 1/2012 by which the scheme was suspended due to its costs. However, the creation of green jobs was seen as a policy priority and currently, there are 400,000 to 500,000 green jobs in Spain, around 2.2{\%} of total employment. Recent austerity measures put this development at risk. Non-ETS emission reduction target: The Spanish target is -10 {\%} (compared to 2005 emissions). Between 2005 and 2011 non-ETS greenhouse gas emissions already declined by 10{\%}. However, according to the latest national projections submitted to the Commission and when existing measures are taken into account, the target is expected to be missed: -2 {\%} in 2020 compared to 2005 (a projected gap of 8 percentage points).},

abstract = {Geological storage is presently one of the most promising options for reducing anthropogenic emissions of CO2. Among the several projects investigating the fate of CO2 stored at depth, the EnCana's CO2 injection EOR (Enhancing Oil Recovery) project at Weyburn (Saskatchewan, Canada) is the most important oil production development that hosts an international monitoring project. In the Weyburn EOR Project CO2 is used to increase recovery of heavy oil from the Midale Beds, a Mississippian reservoir consisting of shallow marine carbonate, where about 3??billions standard m3 of supercritical CO2 have been injected since 2000 with an injection rate of 5000??ton/day. In this work the available dataset (bulk mineralogy of the reservoir, gas-cap composition and selected pre- and post-CO2 injection water samples) provided by the International Energy Agency Weyburn CO2 Monitoring {\&} Storage Project has been used in order to:i)reconstruct the pre-injection reservoir chemical composition (including pH and the boundary conditions at 62????C and 15??MPa);ii)assess the evolution of the reservoir subjected to CO2 injection and predict dissolution/precipitation processes of the Weyburn brines over 100??years after injection;iii)validate the short-term (September 2000-2003) evolution of the in situ reservoir fluids due to the CO2 injection, by comparing the surface analytical data with the composition of the computed depressurized brines. To achieve these goals the PRHEEQC (V2.14) Software Package was used with both modified thermodynamic database and correction for supercritical CO2 fugacity. The oil-gas-water interaction and the non-ideality of the gas phase (with exception of CO2) were not considered in the numerical simulations. Despite intrinsic limitations and uncertainties of geochemical modeling, the main results can be summarized, as follows: 1) the calculated pre-injection chemical composition of the Midale Beds brine is consistent with the analytical data of the waters collected in 2000 (baseline survey), 2) the main reservoir reactions (CO2 and carbonate dissolution) take place within the first year of simulation, 3) the temporal evolution of the chemical features of the fluids in the Weyburn reservoir suggests that CO2 can safely be stored by solubility (as CO2(aq)) and mineral trapping (via dawsonite precipitation). The short-term validation performed by calculating chemical composition of the reservoir fluids (corrected for surface conditions) after the simulation of 3??years of CO2 injection is consistent (error ??? 5{\%}) with the analytical data of the wellhead water samples collected in 2003, with the exception of Ca and Mg (error {\textgreater} 90{\%}), likely due to complexation effect of carboxilic acid. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As any industrial activity, CO 2 storage may lead to adverse impact on human health and the environment in the case of unexpected leakage from the reservoir. These potential impacts should be considered in a risk assessment process.We present an approach to assess the impacts on human health in case of CO 2 leakage emerging in the unsaturated zone under a building. We first focus on the migration of the CO 2 in the unsaturated zone and the foundation through numerical simulation with sensitivity analysis. Our results show that the intrusion of CO 2 into a building is substantially attenuated by the unsaturated zone and the foundation and may lead only under very specific conditions (very low ventilated parts of buildings, high flow rate and/or building situated very close to a leaking pathway) to hazardous CO 2 indoor concentrations.We have then integrated the former results in a global toolbox that provides an efficient and easy-to-use tool for decision support, which enables to assess the impacts on human health of CO 2 leakage from the reservoir to a building. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Plastic production has increased dramatically worldwide over the last 60 years and it is nowadays recognized as a serious threat to the marine environment. Plastic pollution is ubiquitous, but quantitative estimates on the global abundance and weight of floating plastics are still limited, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere and the more remote regions. Some large-scale convergence zones of plastic debris have been identified, but there is the urgency to standardize common methodologies to measure and quantify plastics in seawater and sediments. Investigations on temporal trends, geographical distribution and global cycle of plastics have management implications when defining the origin, possible drifting tracks and ecological consequences of such pollution. An elevated number of marine species is known to be affected by plastic contamination, and a more integrated ecological risk assessment of these materials has become a research priority. Beside entanglement and ingestion of macro debris by large vertebrates, microplastics are accumulated by planktonic and invertebrate organisms, being transferred along food chains. Negative consequences include loss of nutritional value of diet, physical damages, exposure to pathogens and transport of alien species. In addition, plastics contain chemical additives and efficiently adsorb several environmental contaminants, thus representing a potential source of exposure to such compounds after ingestion. Complex ecotoxicological effects are increasingly reported, but the fate and impact of microplastics in the marine environment are still far to be fully clarified.},

abstract = {Objectives: Firefighters are potentially exposed to a wide range of known and suspected carcinogens through their work. The objectives of this study were to examine the patterns of cancer among Nordic firefighters, and to compare them with the results from previous studies. Methods: Data for this study were drawn from a linkage between the census data for 15 million people from the five Nordic countries and their cancer registries for the period 1961-2005. SIR analyses were conducted with the cancer incidence rates for the entire national study populations used as reference rates. Results: A total of 16 422 male firefighters were included in the final cohort. A moderate excess risk was seen for all cancer sites combined, (SIR=1.06, 95{\%} CI 1.02 to 1.11). There were statistically significant excesses in the age category of 30-49 years in prostate cancer (SIR=2.59, 95{\%} CI 1.34 to 4.52) and skin melanoma (SIR=1.62, 95{\%} CI 1.14 to 2.23), while there was almost no excess in the older ages. By contrast, an increased risk, mainly in ages of 70 years and higher, was observed for non-melanoma skin cancer (SIR=1.40, 95{\%} CI 1.10 to 1.76), multiple myeloma (SIR=1.69, 95{\%} CI 1.08 to 2.51), adenocarcinoma of the lung (SIR=1.90, 95{\%} CI 1.34 to 2.62), and mesothelioma (SIR=2.59, 95{\%} CI 1.24 to 4.77). By contrast with earlier studies, the incidence of testicular cancer was decreased (SIR=0.51, 95{\%} CI 0.23 to 0.98). Conclusions: Some of these associations have been observed previously, and potential exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, asbestos and shift work involving disruption of circadian rhythms may partly explain these results. ? 2014 by the BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.},

abstract = {Although the concept of geological CO2 storage is sound, and storage projects will be engineered to the highest level in order to minimize leakage of injected CO2 to surface, a clear understanding of potential hazards is needed to best inform policy makers and the public at large. Though much research has focussed on the effects of increasing global atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plants and marine ecosystems, less is known about the effects of high, but very localised, CO2 concentrations originating from depth. This paper summarises some of the findings from the EC-funded NASCENT project (Natural Analogues for the Storage of CO2 in the Geological Environment), which studied a number of natural CO2 seeps throughout Europe. Of these, four sites were chosen for this overview paper which allowed different leakage processes and impacts to be assessed. One site was located in northern Greece, around the commercially producing Florina CO2 gas field. The other three sites were in central Italy, including: i) a selected area of the Latera geothermal complex, where natural deep CO2 migrates upwards along faults and is emitted to the atmosphere; ii) the San Vittorino intermontane basin where CO2-charged groundwaters cause extensive dissolution of limestone to form large sinkholes; and iii) the Ciampino area to the southeast of Rome, where CO2 derived from deep-seated volcanism within the Alban hills complex migrates along faults in a residential area. Work performed on these sites included soil gas, CO2 flux and aqueous geochemical surveys, as well as the development of a GIS based model for the Latera site which assesses the risk of deep gas migration to surface. Results indicate modifications in groundwater chemistry, sinkhole formation and elevated toxic gas exposure risks in these areas caused by the occurrence of numerous active CO2 vents, however data also show that effects can be spatially restricted and that health risks can be minimised with simple and inexpensive approaches and regulations.},

abstract = {The great increase in the number of deaths attributed to cancer of the lung in the last 25 years justifies the search for a cause in the environment. An investigation was therefore carried out into the possible association of carcinoma of the lung with smoking, exposure to car and fuel fumes, occupation, etc. The preliminary findings with regard to smoking are reported. The material for the investigation was obtained from twenty hospitals in the London region which notified patients with cancer of the lung, stomach, and large bowel. Almoners then visited and interviewed each patient. The patients with carcinoma of the stomach and large bowel served for comparison and, in addition, the almoners interviewed a non-cancer control group of general hospital patients, chosen so as to be of the same sex and age as the lung-carcinoma patients. Altogether 649 men and 60 women with carcinoma of the lung were interviewed. Of the men 0.3{\%} and of the women 31.7�{\%} were non-smokers (as defined in the text). The corresponding figures for the non-cancer control groups were: men 4.20/o, women 53.3{\%}. Among the smokers a relatively high proportion of the patients with carcinoma of the lung fell in the heavier smoking categorie3. For example, 26.0{\%} of the male and 14.6{\%} of the female lung-carcinoma patients who smoked gave as their most recent smoking habits prior to their illness the equivalent of 25 or more cigarettes a day, while only 13.5{\%} of the male and none of the female non-cancer control patients smoked as much. Similar differences were found when comparisons were made between the maximum amounts ever smoked and the estimated total amounts ever smoked. Cigarette smoking was more closely related to carcinoma of the lung than pipe smoking. No distinct association was found with inhaling. Taken as a whole, the lung-carcinoma patients had begun to smoke earlier and had continued for longer than the controls, but the differences were very small and not statistically significant. Rather fewer lung-carcinoma patients had given up smoking. Consideration has been given to the possibility that the results could have been produced by the selection of an unsuitable group of control patients, by patients with respiratory disease exaggerating their smoking habits, or by bias on the part of the interviewers. Reasons are given for excluding all these possibilities, and it is concluded that smoking is an important factor in the cause of carcinoma of the lung. From consideration of the smoking histories given by the patients without cancer of the lung a tentative estimate was made of the number of people who smoked different amounts of tobacco in Greater London, and hence the relative risks of developing the disease among different grades of smokers were calculated. The figures obtained are admittedly speculative, but suggest that, above the age of 45, the risk of developing the disease increases in simple proportion with the amount smoked, and that it may be approximately 50 times as great among those who smoke 25 or more cigarettes a day as among non-smokers. The observed sex ratio among non-smokers (based, it must be stressed, on very few cases) can be readily accounted for if the true incidence among non-smokers is equal in both sexes. It is not possible to deduce a simple time relationship between the increased consumption of tobacco and the increased number of deaths attributed to cancer of the lung. This may be because part of the increase is apparent-that is, due to improved diagnosis-but it may also be because the carcinogen},

Carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks are a natural part of the carbon cycle; however, natural terrestrial sinks are not sufficient to absorb all the CO2 emitted to the atmosphere each year. Due to present concerns about global climate change related to GHG emissions, efforts are underway to assess CO2 sinks, both terrestrial and geologic, as a form of carbon management to offset emissions from fossil fuel combustion and other human activities.

abstract = {A major contributor to increased atmospheric CO2 levels is fossil fuel combustion. Roughly one third of the carbon emissions in the United States comes from power plants. Since electric generation is expected to grow and fossil fuels will continue to be the dominant fuel source, there is growing recognition that the energy industry can be part of the solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by capturing and permanently sequestering CO2. Consequently, an important component of the United States Department of Energy's (DOE) research and development program is dedicated to reducing CO2 emissions from power plants by developing technologies for capturing CO2 and for subsequent utilization and/or sequestration. Injection of CO2 into geologic formations is being practiced today by the petroleum industry for enhanced oil recovery, but it is not yet possible to predict with confidence storage volumes, formation integrity and permanence over long time periods. Many important issues dealing with geologic storage, monitoring and verification of fluids (including CO2) in underground oil and gas reservoirs, coal beds and saline formations must be addressed. Field demonstrations are needed to confirm practical considerations, such as economics, safety, stability, permanence and public acceptance. This paper presents an overview of DOE's research program in the area of CO2 sequestration and storage in geologic formations and specifically addresses the status of new knowledge, improved tools and enhanced technology for cost optimization, monitoring, modeling and capacity estimation. This paper also highlights those fundamental and applied studies, including field tests, sponsored by DOE that are measuring the degree to which CO2 can be injected and remain safely and permanently sequestered in geologic formations while concurrently assuring no adverse long term ecological impacts.

abstract = {In the presence of heteroscedasticity, OLS estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are inconsistent. However, tests based on a het- eroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM) are consistent. While most applications using a HCCM appear to be based on the asymptotic version of the HCCM, there are three additional, relatively unknown, small sample versions of the HCCM that were proposed by MacKinnon and White (1985), based on work by Hinkley (1977), Horn, Horn and Duncan (1975), and Efron (1982). Our objective in this paper is to provide more extensive evidence for the superiority of a version of the HCCM known as HC3. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the most commonly used form of HCCM, known as HC0, results in incorrect inferences in small samples. We recommend that the data analyst should: a) correct for heteroscedasticity using HCCM whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; b) the decision to correct for het- eroscedasticity should not be based on a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and c) if the sample is less than 250, a small sample version of the HCCM known as HC3 should be used.},

abstract = {Monitoring is essential to assess whether sequestered carbon dioxide (CO2) behaves as expected and a variety of monitoring techniques have been proposed and examined. Although those techniques provide useful information, such as CO2 migration and distribution, individual information yields only limited insight into CO2 behavior in geological reservoirs. To deepen our understanding of migration and containment of sequestered CO2, a monitoring framework must be established to comprehend the individual sources of information. This paper describes the monitoring framework that was applied to a pilot project of CO2 storage conducted at an onshore site in Nagaoka, Japan. The target aquifer was the early Pleistocene sandstone bed, around 60m thick and 1100m below the ground surface. During the 554-day injection period, around 10,400tonnes of CO2 were sequestered. Three monitoring wells were completed around an injection well and several monitoring schemes, including continuous measurements of pressure and temperature, well logging, crosswell tomography, and in situ fluid sampling, were applied. Based on the individual monitoring results, meso-scale as well as macro-scale migration of sequestered CO2 was examined. These multi-scale observations on CO2 migration were not in contradiction with each other but were consistent as a whole. In particular, the compositional analysis of in situ fluid samples in conjunction with time-lapse well logging played an important role in understanding meso-scale migration of CO2, and flow simulation provided remarkable insights into the process of macro- and meso-scale migration. This study discusses monitoring and simulation studies for assessing multi-scale migration, with emphasis on the importance of comprehensive analyses, since they can bridge the gap between the individual monitoring outcomes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The concentrations, sources, contamination levels, sample collection and analytical tools of heavy metals in urban soils, urban road dusts and agricultural soils were widely compared and discussed in this study. The results indicate that nearly all the concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Hg and Cd are higher than their background values of soil in China. Among the cities, the contamination levels of the heavy metals vary in a large range. The geoaccumulation index shows that the contamination of Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd is widespread in urban soils and urban road dusts of the cities. Generally, the contamination levels of Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd are higher than that of Ni and Cr. Agricultural soils are also significantly influenced by Cd, Hg and Pb derived from anthropogenic activities. The integrated pollution index (IPI) indicates that the urban soils and urban road dusts of the developed cities and the industrial cities have higher contamination levels of the heavy metals. The comparison of the IPIs of heavy metals in urban soils and urban road dusts of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Hongkong reveals that the contamination levels of the metals in urban road dusts are higher than that in urban soils in the cities. Moreover, the main sources of the metals in urban soils, urban road dusts and agricultural soils are also different. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) Otway Project in Australia is the first heavily monitored pilot site for CO2 storage in a depleted natural gas reservoir. With the site characterisation and risk analysis complete, the new CRC-1 injection well was drilled in April 2007. An updated static and dynamic model forecast an injected gas transit time of between 4 and 8months between CRC-1 injection and Naylor-1 observation wells. Injection began on March 18th 2008 and was halted on August 29th 2009 with 65,445 tonnes of CO2 mixed gas stored. Two pulses of tracer compounds were added to help identify the injected CO2 from other naturally occurring CO2 and to track dispersion and diffusion. Assurance monitoring included surveillance of the atmosphere, soil gas and shallow groundwater. To date, no tracer compounds have been detected above background levels in samples taken as part of the assurance monitoring system. Monitoring of the reservoir has been accomplished with a combined geophysical and geochemical approach. Formation fluids are sampled at pressure with the multilevel U-Tube system. The transient geochemistry at the observation well has: (1) recorded injected gas arrival at the Naylor-1 observation well; (2) recorded tracer compound arrival at Naylor-1; (3) shown a mixing trend between the isotopic signature of the Naylor indigenous CO2 and that of the injection supply gas; and (4) provided an estimate for the dynamic storage capacity for a portion of the Naylor reservoir. The data collected are compared with the pre-injection dynamic model forecasts and provide a means of calibration. The CO2CRC Otway Project has successfully demonstrated the storage of CO2 in a depleted gas field. Geochemical assurance monitoring and reservoir surveillance will continue post injection. Continued analysis of the data will serve to reduce uncertainty in forecasting long term fate of the injected CO2 mixed gas. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Plastic debris is an environmentally persistent and complex contaminant of increasing concern. Understanding the sources, abundance and composition of microplastics present in the environment is a huge challenge due to the fact that hundreds of millions of tonnes of plastic material is manufactured for societal use annually, some of which is released to the environment. The majority of microplastics research to date has focussed on the marine environment. Although freshwater and terrestrial environments are recognised as origins and transport pathways of plastics to the oceans, there is still a comparative lack of knowledge about these environmental compartments. It is highly likely that microplastics will accumulate within continental environments, especially in areas of high anthropogenic influence such as agricultural or urban areas. This review critically evaluates the current literature on the presence, behaviour and fate of microplastics in freshwater and terrestrial environments and, where appropriate, also draws on relevant studies from other fields including nanotechnology, agriculture and waste management. Furthermore, we evaluate the relevant biological and chemical information from the substantial body of marine microplastic literature, determining the applicability and comparability of this data to freshwater and terrestrial systems. With the evidence presented, the authors have set out the current state of the knowledge, and identified the key gaps. These include the volume and composition of microplastics entering the environment, behaviour and fate of microplastics under a variety of environmental conditions and how characteristics of microplastics influence their toxicity. Given the technical challenges surrounding microplastics research, it is especially important that future studies develop standardised techniques to allow for comparability of data. The identification of these research needs will help inform the design of future studies, to determine both the extent and potential ecological impacts of microplastic pollution in freshwater and terrestrial environments.},

abstract = {Anomalous concentrations of CO2 and, to a lesser extent, CH4 have been detected over many active geothermal systems. The production of these gases, and of N2O, can be affected by both geothermal and biological processes. In this investigation, soil gas and soil-gas fluxes were measured at the Cove Fort-Sulphurdale geothermal field in Utah, which produces steam from both liquid- and vapor-dominated portions of the resource. The objectives were to determine the sources of these gases, the factors controlling their production, and the potential application to surface exploration and reservoir evaluation. Flux measurements were made in both summer and winter to evaluate and to quantify variations in seasonal noise. Carbon dioxide in soil gas, and in fluxes from the soil to the atmosphere during the summer sampling were dominated by soil respiration processes. During the winter, a geothermal component was visible. Methane fluxes were small negative values during the summer months, reflecting methanotrophic oxidation of atmospheric CH4 and, possibly, geothermal CH4 in the soils. Nitrous oxide in soil gas and in soil-gas fluxes to the atmosphere also varied seasonally. Surprisingly high concentrations were observed at locations directly above the steam cap. We suggests that NH3 produced in the geothermal reservoir by the Haber reaction was seeping upward where it was biologically oxidized to NO3 -. This oxidation, and possible localized biological reduction of NO3 - to N2, produced moderate amounts of N2O, averaging three times typical background flux rates and ten times background over the central portion of the geothermal area. There were higher fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O over the steam cap and the surrounding area, relative to background values. The high flux may reflect seepage of gas along faults that intersect the more extensive liquid-dominated portion of the reservoir. Nitrous oxide measurements in soil gas and soil-gas fluxes to the atmosphere offer promise as an exploration and reservoir characterization tool. (C) 2000 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Objective: This research aims to explain the migration decision-making process of Delta Mahakam household. In detail, this research will consider the impact of climate change in the migration decision-making process of household who emigrated from their village. The increasing number of household migrating from their village suggests the importance of understanding the reason underline their movements. Methods: The data collected included qualitative data from in-depth interviews. An interview guide was formulated to facilitate in-depth interviews and generate a better understanding of migration behavior. Expectation: Migration is one of the strategies undertaken to maintain the economic resilience of coastal households. Result: Rising seas is one of those climate change impacts in Delta Mahakam. The impact of climate change forces the household to abandon their hometown. Migration decisions of coastal household in Delta Mahakam are complex, involving both economic and non-economic considerations. These results provide an understanding of how climate change will reshape future population distributions.

The model provides proxy radon concentrations for about 21,000 houses in a Danish case-control study on the possible association between residential radon and childhood cancer (primarily leukaemia). The model was calibrated against radon measurements in 3116 houses. An independent dataset with 788 house measurements was used for model performance assessment. The model includes nine explanatory variables, of which the most important ones are house type and geology. All explanatory variables are available from central databases. The model was fitted to log-transformed radon concentrations and it has an R(2) of 40{\%}. The uncertainty associated with individual predictions of (untransformed) radon concentrations is about a factor of 2.0 (one standard deviation). The comparison with the independent test data shows that the model makes sound predictions and that errors of radon predictions are only weakly correlated with the estimates themselves (R(2) = 10{\%}).},

First, it reviews what we know about the factors that drive migration from developing to developed countries. Second, it reviews existing knowledge about the impact of international migration and remittances on the economic and human development of migrants' source countries. These first two sections of the paper are accompanied by an assessment of the gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled with further research. The last section of the paper outlines policies that could help raise the development impact of migration and remittances. First, governments should extend absentee voting rights to overseas citizens. In addition, facilitating migrants' access to and use of financial services could bring substantial benefits. Furthermore, governments can profitably devote self-discovery and enterprise promotion efforts to small-scale activities. Finally, there could be substantial benefits from encouraging overseas citizens to retire at home while taking advantage of accumulated retirement benefits from their migration host countries.},

It is a typical, non tidal and stratified Mediterranean estuary which, although is not heavily polluted, is affected by a lot of human activities (darns, agriculture, fishing, etc.) that, in combination with its hydrological and morphological characteristics, affect also the distribution of trace metals. The concentration levels of metals in the estuary are lower than in polluted Greek gulfs and rivers. In the Acheloos case, in contrast to polluted estuaries, the dissolved metal concentrations are increased seawards whereas the particulate metal concentrations and the metal content of the particles are decreased. Suspended particulate matter and especially particles having diameter {\textless} 8 ??m were found to play an important role in the processes related to trace metal mobility. These processes include desorption of particulate metals seawards, adsorption of dissolved metals on increased particulate loads, non conservative behaviour of both dissolved and particulate metals and association of particulate metals with particulate Al, Fe and Mn. The behaviour of metals show that Cu, Pb and Mn are possible dangerous pollutants for the system.},

This site represents a natural laboratory for CO2/fluid/rock interactions studies, as well as CO2 migration mechanisms towards the surface. The CO2 leaking character of the studied area also allows to test and validate measurements methods and verifications for the future CO2 geological storage sites. During these surveys, we analyzed soil CO2 fluxes and concentrations. We sampled and analyzed soil gases, and gas from carbo-gaseous bubbling springs. A one-month continuous monitoring was also tested, to record the concentration of CO2 both in atmosphere and in the soil at a single point. We also developed a new methodology to collect soil gas samples for noble gas abundances and isotopic analyses, as well as carbon isotopic ratios. Our geochemical results, combined with structural geology, show that the leaking CO2 has a very deep origin, partially mantle derived. The gas rises rapidly along normal and strike-slip active faults. CO2 soil concentrations (also showing a mantle derived component) and CO2 fluxes are spatially variable, and reach high values. The recorded atmospheric CO2 is not very high, despite the important CO2 degassing throughout the whole area.},

Thus, the present Recommendations update the radiation and tissue weighting factors in the quantities equivalent and effective dose and update the radiation detriment, based on the latest available scientific information of the biology and physics of radiation exposure. They maintain the Commission's three fundamental principles of radiological protection, namely justification, optimisation, and the application of dose limits, clarifying how they apply to radiation sources delivering exposure and to individuals receiving exposure. The Recommendations evolve from the previous process-based protection approach using practices and interventions by moving to an approach based on the exposure situation. They recognise planned, emergency, and existing exposure situations, and apply the fundamental principles of justification and optimisation of protection to all of these situations. They maintain the Commission's current individual dose limits for effective dose and equivalent dose from all regulated sources in planned exposure situations. They reinforce the principle of optimisation of protection, which should be applicable in a similar way to all exposure situations, subject to the following restrictions on individual doses and risks; dose and risk constraints for planned exposure situations, and reference levels for emergency and existing exposure situations. The Recommendations also include an approach for developing a framework to demonstrate radiological protection of the environment.},

In the present study, effects of thoron on the most common type of PIC detector (commercial name AlphaGUARD) were investigated using an exposure chamber. The AlphaGUARD was exposed to a mixture of radon and thoron, together with a radon/thoron discriminative monitor that employs a silicon solid-state detector. The thoron sensitivity of the PIC detector was estimated by comparing the two detectors. As a result, the thoron sensitivity was about 10{\%} compared with the radon sensitivity. In other words, the radon concentration (Bq m(-3)) measured with the PIC detector was approximately the sum of the actual radon concentration (Bq m(-3)) and 10{\%} of the thoron concentration (Bq m(-3)). The sensitivity to thoron should be considered in measurements in thoron-enhanced areas.},

abstract = {In April 2011, we published the first comprehensive analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shale gas obtained by hydraulic fracturing, with a focus on methane emissions. Our analysis was challenged by Cathles et al. (2012). Here, we respond to those criticisms. We stand by our approach and findings. The latest EPA estimate for methane emissions from shale gas falls within the range of our estimates but not those of Cathles et al. which are substantially lower. Cathles et al. believe the focus should be just on electricity generation, and the global warming potential of methane should be considered only on a 100-year time scale. Our analysis covered both electricity (30{\%} of US usage) and heat generation (the largest usage), and we evaluated both 20- and 100-year integrated time frames for methane. Both time frames are important, but the decadal scale is critical, given the urgent need to avoid climate-system tipping points. Using all available information and the latest climate science, we conclude that for most uses, the GHG footprint of shale gas is greater than that of other fossil fuels on time scales of up to 100 years. When used to generate electricity, the shale-gas footprint is still significantly greater than that of coal at decadal time scales but is less at the century scale. We reiterate our conclusion from our April 2011 paper that shale gas is not a suitable bridge fuel for the 21st Century.},

abstract = {This review paper discusses the perspectives for development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies in the global fight against climate change, such as low-carbon technology which is a vital component to reduce future carbon emissions. The information on the level and growth of CO 2 emissions, their source and geographic distribution, will be essential to lay the foundation for a global agreement; considering only for energy-related CO2, and not for any other greenhouse gases. We analyzed the distribution of the CO2 emission intensity related to them. Besides, in order to predict possible future situations of energy consumption, CO2 emissions intensity and the CCS role like the largest emission reduction potential, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has developed a number of scenarios; the baseline scenarios and comparative scenarios. We used the approach of the Blue Map Scenarios, bringing the 2005s emissions to a level of 50{\%} by 2050 for a non-catastrophic human intervention in the climate system. Moreover, this paper shows the barriers, strategies for accelerating and the stages in the technology deployment. We also analyzed the CCS projects status; Challenges, SWOT analysis, and the currently Global CCS Technology Activity. For this, we consider the Large Scale Integrated Projects (LSIP), and the asset life-cycle model was used to categorize the status of a project according to its development stage. Alongside, the analysis involves: Total LSIPs by geographic region, by Industry and CO2 Capture Technology. In addition, we also made a scope on some of the most relevant international actions in order to stimulate the fulfillment of the CO 2 intensity target. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The application of geostatistics to data obtained from geochemical prospecting process can provide useful information for evaluating mineralization potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial distribution of Au, As and Sb contents over a large area of the Coru{\~{n}}a province, Spain. A geochemical survey was carried out from which a data set with 323 samples was collected. Macroelements and trace elements were determined by routine analytical techniques. The spatial variability was assessed using semivariogram and cross-semivariogram as well as indicator semivariogram analysis. Frequency distributions of the studied elements departed from normal, as indicated by skewness and kurtosis coefficients. Coefficients of variation ranked as follows: Sb {\textless} As {\textless} Au. Significant correlation coefficients between Au, Sb and As were found, even though the correlation values were low. Spherical models with nugget effects ranging from 50{\%} (As) to 57.8{\%} (Au) were fitted to the experimental semivariograms. Cross semivariograms of Au versus Sb and As showed smaller nugget variance than individual semivariograms. Indicator semivariograms were calculated taken mean, median, and different percentiles as threshold values. Ordinary kriging, cokriging, and indicator kriging were performed to generate geochemical maps. The method has succeeded in effectively extracting useful information, and improving the analysis of the metallogenic and ore-controlling factors, thereby playing an important role in qualitative and quantitative predictions.},

Two gender inequality indicators are used: the gap in female to male primary education enrolment ratios and the gap in female to male secondary education enrolment ratios. Estimation results indicate that gender inequality in primary and secondary education has a statistically significant negative effect on income, especially in North African and Middle Eastern countries. In relatively open economies, gender inequality in education seems to have an additional effect, but this effect is consistently positive, suggesting that while trade contributes to higher income it may be accompanied by greater inequality. Overall, the results in this paper provide further evidence that the international development community's focus on reducing gender inequality and achieving universal primary education is well founded.},

Topsoil sampling locations were selected as to be representative of European landscape using a Latin hypercube stratified random sampling, taking into account CORINE land cover 2000, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM and its derived slope, aspect and curvature.In this study we will discuss how the LUCAS topsoil database can be used to map soil properties at continental scale over the geographical extent of Europe. Several soil properties were predicted using hybrid approaches like regression kriging. In this paper we describe the prediction of topsoil texture and related derived physical properties. Regression models were fitted using, along other variables, remotely sensed data coming from the MODIS sensor. The high temporal resolution of MODIS allowed detecting changes in the vegetative response due to soil properties, which can then be used to map soil features distribution. We will also discuss the prediction of intrinsically collinear variables like soil texture which required the use of models capable of dealing with multivariate constrained dependent variables like Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).Cross validation of the fitted models proved that the LUCAS dataset constitutes a good sample for mapping purposes leading to cross-validation R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} between 0.47 and 0.50 for soil texture and normalized errors between 4 and 10{\%}.},

A total of 70 samples of commonly used building materials were collected from various manufacturers and suppliers throughout the country and analyzed using a HPGe gamma ray spectrometer. The specific activities of 226Ra, 232Th, and 40K were measured in all samples, and results ranged from minimum values of {\textless}1, {\textless}1, and 4 Bq kg(-1) to maximum values of 139, 57, and 1,977 Bq kg(-1), with mean values of 32, 18, and 353 Bq kg(-1), respectively. Results obtained were compared with relevant national, EU, and international legislation and guidance, and with the results of similar studies undertaken in other countries. These activities would suggest that the use of such building materials in the construction of domestic dwellings or workplaces in Ireland is unlikely to give rise to any significant radiation exposure to the occupants. In general, these activities were comparable to the results of similar studies undertaken in other countries. 137Cs activity was also detected in some samples.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Society of Exploration Geophysicists. Coastal areas such as the German Bight are at risk from storms and rising sea level that may affect the hydrogeologic setting. Because knowledge of the distribution of clayey sediments is important for understanding the current status of this dynamic setting, the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) has focused on geophysical research projects on the North Sea coast applying airborne and ground geophysics. The airborne system operated by BGR was used to survey a 20by 31-km large coastal area in Eastern Friesland, Germany, including the islands of Langeoog and Spiekeroog. Helicopter-borne electromagnetic (HEM) data were collected at six frequencies. In addition, the Leibniz Institute for Applied Geophysics commissioned a SkyTEM survey covering a 2-km-wide north-south strip. On the island of Langeoog, ground geophysical methods, such as transient electromagnetics (TEM) and magnetic resonance soundings (MRS) were used to investigate the hydrogeologic setting in greater detail. Onshore, the airborne electromagnetic results clearly outlined a complex electrically conductive pattern occurring at a shallow depth. Comparison with borehole results provided by the State Authority for Mining, Energy and Geology confirmed that these conductors were caused by clayey material, particularly down to an approximate 20-m depth. This pattern continues offshore, and it is likely that the saltwater is linked to stripes of clayey sediments and the fresh groundwater flows out to the Wadden Sea in between. On the islands, the HEM results revealed the freshwater lenses and showed some indications for clay layers within these freshwater lenses. The application of TEM and MRS helped to distinguish lithology from salinity and confirmed the existence of these clay layers. We demonstrated the usefulness of combining the spatial airborne data with geophysical and borehole data available at sparsely distributed sites on the ground to investigate hydrogeologic settings.},

abstract = {In the paper we share our operational experience gained from three sites: Sleipner (14 years of injection), In Salah (6 years) and Sn??hvit (2 years). Together, these three sites have disposed 16 Mt of CO2 by 2010. In highly variable reservoirs, with permeability ranging from a few milliDarcy to more than one Darcy, single wells have injected several hundred Kt of CO2 per year. In the reservoirs, the actual CO2 plume development has been strongly controlled by geological factors that we learned about during injection. Geophysical monitoring methods (especially seismic, gravity, and satellite data) have, at each site, revealed some of these unpredicted geological factors. Thus monitoring methods are as valuable for reservoir characterisation as they are for monitoring fluid saturation and pressure changes. Current scientific debates that address CO2 storage capacity mainly focus on the utilization of the pore space (efficiency) and the rate of pressure dissipation in response to injection (pressure limits). We add to this that detailed CO2 site characterisation and monitoring is needed to prove significant practical CO2 storage capacity - on a case by case basis. As this specific site experience and knowledge develops more general conclusions on storage capacity, injectivity and efficiency may be possible. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Estimates of CO2 emissions at spreading centres, convergent margins and plumes have been reviewed and upgraded using observed CO2/3He ratios in magmatic volatiles, 3He content estimates in the magmatic sources, and magma emplacement rates in the different tectonic settings. The effect of volatile fractionation during magma degassing, investigated using new rare gas and CO2 abundances determined simultaneously for a suite of Mid-Ocean Rdige (MOR) basalt glasses, is not the major factor controlling the spread of data, which mainly result from volatile heterogeneity in the mantle source. The computed C flux at ridges (2.2 ?? 0.9) x 1012 mol/a, is essentially similar to previous estimates based on a more restricted database. Variation of the C flux in the past can be simply scaled to that of spreading rate since the computed C depends mainly on the volatile content of the mantle source, which can be considered constant during the last 108 a. The flux of CO2 from arcs may be approximated using the CO2/3He ratios of volcanic gases at arcs and the magma emplacement rate, assuming that the 3He content of the mantle end-member is that of the MORB source. The resulting flux is {\~{}} 2.5 x 1012 mol/a. Significant enhancements of the CO2 flux from plumes might have occurred in the past during giant magma emplacements, depending on the duration of these events, although the time-integrated effect does not appear important. The global magmatic flux of CO2 into the atmosphere and the hydrosphere is found to be 6 x 1012 mol/a, with a range of (4-10) x 1012 mol/a. Improvement on the precision of this estimate is linked to a better understanding of the volatile inventory at arcs on one hand, and on the dynamics of plumes and their mantle source contribution on the other hand.},

abstract = {One of the proposals for large-scale sequestration of fossil fuel-derived CO2 is deep geologic disposal in depleted oil/ gas reservoirs or deep aquifers. Previously published scenarios for this inadequately proven technology have either ignored or dismissed the possibility of vertical migration of gases caused by overpressure. Overpressuring of a reservoir or aquifer will be necessary in order to have acceptable rates for dispersal of injected CO2. This research describes methodology and the results of measurement of microseepage of CO2 and CH4 at a large-scale CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operation at Rangely, Colorado, USA. Shallow and deep soil gas concentrations, and direct transport of CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere were measured. The interpretation of the measurements was complemented by both stable and radiogenic isotopic measurements of C. The results have demonstrated an estimated microseepage to the atmosphere of approximately 400 metric tonnes of CH4/a from the 78 km2 area of the Rangely field. Preliminary estimates of deep-sourced CO2 losses are {\textless}3800 tonnes/a, based on stable isotope measurements of soil gases. Several holes up to 10 m deep were drilled on, and off the field for nested gas sampling of composition and stable C isotopic ratios for CO2 and CH4. Carbon-14 measurements on CO2 from these holes indicate that deep-sourced CO2 microseepage losses were approximately 170 tonnes/a. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The follow-up of Fukushima radioactive plume resulting from the 11th March 2011 devastating tsunami is discussed for two Italian stations in the northern Apennines: Mt. Cimone (Modena) and Montecuccolino (Bologna). Radioactivity data collected at both stations are described, including comparison between local natural background of airborne particulate and artificial radioactivity referable to the arrival of the radioactive plume and its persistence and evolution. Analysis of back-trajectories was used to confirm the arrival of artificial radionuclides following atmospheric transport and processing. The Fukushima plume was first detected on 3rd April 2011 when high volume sampling revealed the presence of the artificial radionuclides 131I, 137Cs and 134Cs. The highest activity concentrations of these nuclides were detected on 5th April 2011 at the Montecuccolino site. Fukushima radioactivity data at the two stations were usually comparable, suggesting a good vertical mixing of the plume; discrepancies were occasional and attributed to different occurrence of wet removal, typically characterized by a scattered spatial pattern. To understand the relevance to the local population of the extra dose due to the Fukushima plume, atmospheric activities of the related artificial nuclides were compared to those of the main natural radionuclides in ambient particulate, and found to be lower by over one order of magnitude. Radiation doses referable to Fukushima, maximized for a whole year occurrence at the highest activity level observed at our stations in the weeks affected by the Japanese plume, were estimated at 1.1 ??Sv/year. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Most building materials of natural origin contain small amounts of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM), mainly radionuclides from the 226Ra and 232Th decay chains and 40K. Building materials of natural origin reflect the geology of their site of origin. The average 226Ra, 232Th and 40K activity concentration in the Earth's crust is 35, 30 and 400 Bq/kg. Industrial waste or by-products containing high concentrations of NORM, e.g. fly ash, coal slag, phosphogypsum, are extensively used in building materials. Several surveys were conducted at different locations worldwide to characterize the activity concentrations of NORM and the radon exhalation rate from raw materials and building materials. The external radiation exposure, caused by the gamma emitting radionuclides, is assessed either by direct exposure measurements or by mathematical calculations. The evaluation of the internal radiation exposure, due to 222Rn exhaled from building materials into the room air, is more complicated and may strongly depend on environmental parameters, e.g. the ventilation rate. The correlation between the radon exhalation rate measured under laboratory conditions and the in-situ wall exhalation rate is not fully understood. Regulation on the radioactivity in building materials is based on dose criteria for controls and on exemption levels. Internal dose limits from 222Rn exhaled from building materials should be kept consistent with national action levels for indoor radon. Setting a low reference radon concentration for building materials will enable to account for contributions from other sources without exceeding the action level.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide sequestration in geologic media is being investigated as a means of reducing emissions to the atmosphere. Oil and gas fields, which were in production decline, have been raised to new production levels by CO2 enhanced recovery. Currently, these fields use nearby geologic sources of CO2. Future enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects are likely to include some industrial CO2, deriving substantial economic benefit over CO2 disposal in deep aquifers. The formation overpressuring required for substantial rates of CO2 injection may drive buoyant gases upward. Although CO2 is likely to be a supercritical fluid, CH4 will remain gaseous and, as such, is much more mobile. If CH4 is driven toward the surface, it represents a potential hazard to shallow water wells and basements. This research presents a protocol for baseline surface geochemical measurements to evaluate the potential risk. The objective is to detect a subtle signal from depth in the presence of a large amount of near surface noise. Carbon dioxide and CH4 soil gas concentrations and exchange with the atmosphere (flux) measurements are necessary. Stable and radiogenic carbon isotopic measurements are required to differentiate the sources of these gases. Examples of these measurements from a CO2 enhanced EOR project at Rangely, Colorado, USA, are presented. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To date, the inorganic composition of nascent sea spray aerosol particles has widely been assumed to be equivalent to the inorganic composition of seawater. Here we challenge this assumption using a laboratory sea spray chamber containing both natural and artificial seawater, as well as with ambient aerosol samples collected over the central Arctic Ocean during summer. We observe significant enrichment of calcium in submicrometer ( {\textless} 1 $\mu$m in diameter) sea spray aerosol particles when particles are generated from both seawater sources in the laboratory as well as in the ambient aerosols samples. We also observe a tendency for increasing calcium enrichment with decreasing particle size. Our results suggest that calcium enrichment in sea spray aerosol particles may be environmentally significant with implications for our understanding of sea spray aerosol, its impact on Earth's climate, as well as the chemistry of the marine atmosphere.},

abstract = {In a 1990-1996 case-control study in western Germany, the authors investigated lung cancer risk due to exposure to residential radon. Confirmed lung cancer cases from hospitals and a random sample of community controls were interviewed by trained interviewers regarding different risk factors. For 1 year, alpha track detectors were placed in dwellings to measure radon gas concentrations. The evaluation included 1,449 cases and 2,297 controls recruited from the entire study area and a subsample of 365 cases and 595 controls from radon-prone areas of the basic study region. Rate ratios were estimated by using conditional logistic regression adjusted for smoking and for asbestos exposure. In the entire study area, no rate ratios different from 1.0 were found; in the radon-prone areas, the adjusted rate ratios for exposure in the present dwelling were 1.59 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 2.27), 1.93 (95{\%} CI: 1.19, 3.13), and 1.93 (95{\%} CI: 0.99, 3.77) for 50-80, 80-140, and {\textgreater}140 Bq/m3, respectively, compared with 0-50 Bq/m3. The excess rate ratio for an increase of 100 Bq/m3 was 0.13 (-0.12 to 0.46). An analysis based on cumulative exposure produced similar results. The results provide additional evidence that residential radon is a risk factor for lung cancer, although a risk was detected in radon-prone areas only, not in the entire study area.},

abstract = {Radon emanation has been observed to be anomalously high along active faults in many parts of the world. We tested this relationship by conducting and repeating soil air radon surveys with a portable radon meter across several faults in California. The results confirm the existence of fault-associated radon anomalies, which show characteristic features that may be related to fault structures but vary in time due to other environmental changes, such as rainfall. Across two creeping faults in San Juan Bautista and Hollister, the radon anomalies showed prominent double peaks straddling the fault gouge zone during dry summers, but the peak-to-background ratios diminished after significant rain fall during winter. Across a locked segment of the San Andreas fault near Olema, the anomaly has a single peak located several meters southwest of the slip zone associated with the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Across two fault segments that ruptured during the magnitude 7.5 Landers earthquake in 1992, anomalously high radon concentration was found in the fractures three weeks after the earthquake. We attribute the fault-related anomalies to a slow vertical gas flow in or near the fault zones. Radon generated locally in subsurface soil has a concentration profile that increases three orders of magnitude from the surface to a depth or several meters; thus an upward flow that brings up deeper and radon-richer soil air to the detection level can cause a significantly higher concentration reading. This explanation is consistent with concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen, measured in soil-air samples collected during one of the surveys.},

abstract = {Exposure to indoor radon is identified as the main source of natural radiation exposure to the population. Since radon in homes originates mainly from soil gas radon, it is of public interest to study the correlation between radon in soil and radon indoors in different geographic locations. From 2007 to 2010, a total of 1070 sites were surveyed for soil gas radon and soil permeability. Among the sites surveyed, 430 sites were in 14 cities where indoor radon information is available from residential radon and thoron surveys conducted in recent years. It is observed that indoor radon potential (percentage of homes above 200 Bq m(-3); range from 1.5{\%} to 42{\%}) correlates reasonably well with soil radon potential (SRP: an index proportional to soil gas radon concentration and soil permeability; average SRP ranged from 8 to 26). In five cities where in-situ soil permeability was measured at more than 20 sites, a strong correlation (R(2) = 0.68 for linear regression and R(2) = 0.81 for non-linear regression) was observed between indoor radon potential and soil radon potential. This summary report shows that soil gas radon measurement is a practical and useful predictor of indoor radon potential in a geographic area, and may be useful for making decisions around prioritizing activities to manage population exposure and future land-use planning.},

abstract = {Microplastics are anthropogenic contaminants which have been found in oceans, lakes and rivers. Investigations focusing on drinking water are rare and studies have mainly been using micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ($\mu$-FT-IR). A major limitation of this technique is its inability to detect particles smaller than 20 $\mu$m. However, micro-Raman spectroscopy is capable of detecting even smaller particle sizes. Therefore, we show that this technique, which was used in this study, is particularly useful in detecting microplastics in drinking water where particle sizes are in the low micrometer range. In our study, we compared the results from drinking water distributed in plastic bottles, glass bottles and beverage cartons. We tested the microplastic content of water from 22 different returnable and single-use plastic bottles, 3 beverage cartons and 9 glass bottles obtained from grocery stores in Germany. Small (–50-500 $\mu$m) and very small (1–50 $\mu$m) microplastic fragments were found in every type of water. Interestingly, almost 80{\%} of all microplastic particles found had a particle size between 5 and 20 $\mu$m and were therefore not detectable by the analytical techniques used in previous studies. The average microplastics content was 118 ± 88 particles/l in returnable, but only 14 ± 14 particles/l in single-use plastic bottles. The microplastics content in the beverage cartons was only 11 ± 8 particles/l. Contrary to our assumptions we found high amounts of plastic particles in some of the glass bottled waters (range 0–253 particles/l, mean 50 ± 52 particles/l). A statistically significant difference from the blank value (14 ± 13) to the investigated packaging types could only be shown comparing to the returnable bottles (p {\textless} 0.05). Most of the particles in water from returnable plastic bottles were identified as consisting of polyester (primary polyethylene terephthalate PET, 84{\%}) and polypropylene (PP; 7{\%}). This is not surprising since the bottles are made of PET and the caps are made of PP. In water from single-use plastic bottles only a few micro-PET-particles have been found. In the water from beverage cartons and also from glass bottles, microplastic particles other than PET were found, for example polyethylene or polyolefins. This can be explained by the fact that beverage cartons are coated with polyethylene foils and caps are treated with lubricants. Therefore, these findings indicate that the packaging itself may release microparticles. The main fraction of the microplastic particles identified are of very small size with dimensions less than 20 $\mu$m, which is not detectable with the $\mu$-FT-IR technique used in previous studies.},

abstract = {Sardinia is typically seismically quiescent, displaying an almost complete lack of historical earthquakes and instrumentally recorded seismicity. This evidence may be in agreement with the presence of a ductile layer in the northern sector of the island, as suggested by the He isotopic signature in fluids rising to the surface through quiescent fault systems. The fault systems have been found to be "segmented" and therefore isolated in fluid circulation. The study of fluid behaviour along fault systems becomes strategically important when applied to solve some geological risk assessments such as Rn-indoor, or to define geological structures like potential CO 2 storage sites. Both of these have been recently requested by the exploitation in Italy of the Euratom Directive and the evolution of the KyotoProtocol policy. Four water-dominated hydrothermal areas of Sardinia, located along regional fault systems, were considered: Campidano Graben, Tirso Valley, Logudoro and Casteldoria. A fluid geochemical survey was carried out taking into account physical-chemical and environmental parameters, major elements within gaseous and liquid phases, a few minor and trace elements, selected isotope ratios (2H, 18O, 13C, 3He/4He), 222Rn concentration, and some dissolved gases. Two different fluids have been recognised as regards both water chemistry and dissolved gases: (i) CO2-rich gases, poor in He and Rn, with a relatively high 3He/4He ratio (up to R/R a = 2.32), associated with Na-HCO3-(Cl) thermal and cold groundwater; (ii) gases rich in He and N2, poor in CO2 and Rn, with a low 3He/4He ratio, associated with alkaline thermal and cold waters. The distribution of these two groups of fluids characterises the Sardinian tectonic systems. In fact, gas fluxes are not homogeneous, being mainly related to the different fault segments and to the areas where Quaternary basalts crop out. The underground geochemical evolution of the Sardinian fluids, as a function of the geological and tectonic systems, provides some suggestions for solving one of the most important problems: CO2 geological sequestration. In order to reduce the CO2 excess produced by human activity, the best geological disposal sites are reservoirs with low hydraulic conductivity, sealed to fluid movement, or aquifers characterised by maximum pH buffering capacity of their mineralogical matrix. The knowledge of the role of faults, as permeability barriers or as deep fluid uprising pathways, is prerequisite. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Nine sampling sites on a hill slope, in the summer and winter 2006 were chosen. Other soil parameters such as moisture, soil type and porosity were also measured. Correlation between the latter and the calculated effective diffusion coefficients, based on a linear approximation, was done in order to explore water movement. A weak correlation between the soil radon concentration and water recharge in this particular semi-arid area is observed. The results show that water recharge takes place vertically, i.e., water moves downward and in one of the nine sampling sites this movement seems to be more rapid compared to the other sites.},

abstract = {To provide detailed information for bronchial dose estimates, aerosol particle size distributions, and radon gas concentration, measurements were made in six residential homes and three laboratory rooms in different office buildings in the city of Ottawa. In the literature, most particle size distribution measurements are taken with samplers operating for a few days at most. In this study, the particle size samplers collected the samples from 77 to 162 d. The equilibrium factor determined from the long-term measurements ranged from 0.6 to almost 1 with an average of 0.75. Even though radon concentrations were quite different between residential setting and office buildings, the average equilibrium factor was similar in the two different indoor environments. The results suggest that at least in some basements, if they were occupied, the radon dose would be about twice as high as normally estimated from the conventional F(eq) value of 0.4.},

abstract = {It is crucial to advance the understanding of the soil carbon dioxide (CO2) flux and environmental factors for a better comprehension of carbon dynamics in subtropical ecosystems. Red soil, one of the typical agricultural soils in subtropical China, plays important roles in the global carbon budget due to their large potential to sequester C and replenish atmospheric C through soil CO2 flux. We examined the relationship between soil CO2 flux and environmental determinants in four different land use types of subtropical red soil-paddy (P), orchard (O), woodland (W) and upland (U) using static closed chamber method. Objectives were to evaluate the relationship of soil temperature, water-filled pore space (WFPS), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with the soil CO2 flux. Soil CO2 fluxes were measured on each site about every 14 days between 09:00 and 11:00 a.m. during 14-July 2004 to 25-April 2007 at the experimental station of Heshengqiao at Xianning, Hubei, China. Soil CO2 fluxes revealed seasonal fluctuations, with the tendency that maximum values occurred in summer, minimum in winter and intermediate values in spring and autumn except for paddy soil when it was submerged. Further, significant differences in soil CO2 fluxes were observed among the four soils, following the order of P {\textgreater} O {\textgreater} U ∼ W. Average soil CO2 fluxes were estimated as 901 ± 114, 727 ± 55, 554 ± 22 and 533 ± 27 (±S.D.) g CO2 m-2 year-1 in paddy, orchard, upland and woodland soils, respectively. Variations in soil CO2 flux were related to soil temperature, WFPS, and dissolved organic carbon with a combined R2 of 0.49-0.75. Soil temperature was an important variable controlling 26-59{\%} of soil CO2 flux variability. The interaction of soil temperature and WFPS could explain 31-60{\%} of soil CO2 flux variations for all the land use types. We conclude that soil CO2 flux from red soil is under environmental controls, soil temperature being the main variable, which interact with WFPS and DOC to control the supply of readily mineralizable substrates. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the agricultural situation in the Duhok governorate during the pre-Anfal (A), post-Anfal (B), reconstruction (C), and present (D) periods, we mapped winter crops by focusing on inter-annual variability in vegetation greenness, using satellite images. The results indicate a decrease in cultivated area between period A and B, and a small increase between period B and C. This supports reports of a decline in cultivated area related to the Anfal campaign, and indicates increased activity during the reconstruction program. Period D showed a potential recovery with a cropland area similar to period A.},

For analysis of microplastics in biota we found that an adapted enzymatic digestion protocol using proteinase K performed best, with a 97{\%} recovery of spiked plastic particles and no observed degradation effects on the plastics in subsequent Raman analysis. Field analysis revealed that 8 of 9 tested invertebrate species from the North Sea and 68{\%} of analyzed individuals of brown trout (Salmo trutta) from the Swedish West Coast had microplastics in them.

Deep sources of gas are characterized by high 222Rn activity and high CO2 efflux, whereas shallow sources are indicated by high 220Rn activity and relatively low CO2 efflux. Excess 220Rn highlights sites of ongoing shallow rock fracturing that could be affected by collapse, as in the case of the rim of an active vent.

abstract = {Elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are implicated in global warming. Mitigation of this requires capture of CO2 from fossil fuel power sources and storage in subsurface aquifers or depleted hydrocarbon fields. Demonstration projects and financial analysis suggest that this is technologically feasible. CO2 must retained below ground for 104 y into the future to enable the surface carbon cycle to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. To provide robust predic- tions of the performance of disposal sites at the required timescale, one approach is to study natural CO2 accumulations, which give insight into rock-CO2-brine interactions over timescales of 103 - 5.106 y. In contrast to geochemical modelling predictions, natural CO2 fields in the North Sea (Brae, Miller, Magnus, Sleipner), at 4.0 km and deeper, do not show the mineral products which are predicted to form. Calcite and feldspar still comprise 5-20{\%} of the rock, and dawsonite is absent. SE Australian and Arizona reservoir sandstones also do not fit to geochemical predictions. A state of disequilibrium possi- bly exists, so that existing geochemical modelling is not capable of accurately predicting kinetic-controlled and surface-chemistry controlled mineral dissolution or precipitation in natural subsurface sand- stones on the required timescales. Improved calibration of models is required. Geochemical evidence from laboratory experiments (months to years duration), or from enhanced oil recovery (30 y duration) are again too short in timescale. To help to bridge the 104 y gap, it may be useful to examine natural ana- logues (103-106 y), which span the timescale required for durable disposal. The Colorado Plateau is a natural CO2 system, analogous to an hydrocarbon system, where 100 Gm3 CO2 fields occur, sourced from 0-5 Ma volcanics. Deep erosion has exposed the sediments which formed CO2 source, CO2 carrier, CO2 reservoir, CO2 trap, CO2 seal. Some very large CO2 traps are now exhumed, and some are currently leaking to form cool travertine springs at the surface. Natural examples at Salt Wash Green River, and at Moab Fault are briefly described. These show extensive bleaching of haematite which may be locally redeposited, carbonate cementation $\delta$13C –7‰ around point sources, and silica precipitation, which may seal leak-off on buried anticline crests. Accurate geochemical modelling of the long-term performance of CO2 storage sites, requires improved understanding of CO2 reaction paths and reaction rates with aquifer reservoirs and with overlying seals. Robust prediction of disposal site performance is not possible without this.},

abstract = {Kerrick and Caldeira (1993, 1994a) concluded that metamorphic CO2 degassing in collisional orgens, and especially the Himalayan orogenic belt, could have been an important factor in enhancing paleoatmospheric CO2 levels and contributing to early Cenozoic global greenhouse warming [Kerrick, D.M., Caldeira, K., 1993. Paleoatmospheric consequences of CO2 released during early Cenozoic regional metamorphism in the Tethyan orogen. In: Touret, J.L.R., Thompson, A.B. (Guest-Eds.), Fluid-Rock Interaction in the Deeper Continental Lithosphere. Chem. Geol. 198, 201-230.] [Kerrick, D.M., Caldeira, K., 1994a. Metamorphic CO2 degassing and early Cenozoic paleoclimate. GSA (Geol. Soc. Am.) Today 4, 57-65.]. However, our revised CO2 mass loss computations for regional metamorphism in the Himalaya-Karakoram belt incorporating recent geochronologic data and revised estimates of the proportion of carbonate source rocks indicate that metamorphic CO2 degassing from this orogen cannot explain Early Eocene warmth. Widespread pluton-induced hydrothermal flow occurred during the Eocene in the Cordilleran belt of western North America. Synmetamorphic intrusions, which are common in metamorphic belts, may cause significant regional fluid flow. To obtain a representative CO2 flux from such environments, we computed a CO2 flux of 1.5 x 1012 mol km-2 Ma-1 from petrologic and geochemical studies of the Paleozoic plutonic-metamorphic belt in New England (northeastern United States). For the 2 x 106 km2 area of Eocene metamorphism in the North American Cordillera, the CO2 fluxes derived from the New England metamorphic belt yield an area-integrated flux of {\~{}}3 x 1018 mol Ma-1. If a significant fraction of this CO2 entered the atmosphere, this degassing flux would alone account for Eocene greenhouse global warming. For the Ominica belt within the Cordilleran orogen, and volumetric estimate of the mass of carbonate veins indicates that the consumption of CO2 by precipitation of carbonate veins may not significantly decrease the amount of CO2 in fluids that convect to near-surface crustal levels. Compared to other Eocene metamorphic belts, the widespread hydrothermal activity in the North American Cordillera may have been the largest, and most climatically significant, source of metamorphic CO2 in the Eocene atmosphere. CO2 degassing by active metamorphism is most significant in extensional regimes of high heat flow. Extensional tectonism and hydrothermal activity in metamorphic belts may have substantially contributed to atmospheric CO2 content throughout the Phanerozoic. Examples include the Mesozoic circum-Pacific metamorphic belt, and Oligocene-Miocene regional metamorphism in the Himalayan orogen.},

abstract = {Fire transforms fuels (i.e. biomass, necromass, soil organic matter) into materials with different chemical and physical properties. One of these materials is ash, which is the particulate residue remaining or deposited on the ground that consists of mineral materials and charred organic components. The quantity and characteristics of ash produced during a wildland fire depend mainly on (1) the total burned fuel (i.e. fuel load), (2) fuel type and (3) its combustion completeness. For a given fuel load and type, a higher combustion completeness will reduce the ash organic carbon content, increasing the relative mineral content, and hence reducing total mass of ash produced. The homogeneity and thickness of the ash layer can vary substantially in space and time and reported average thicknesses range from close to 0 to 50. mm. Ash is a highly mobile material that, after its deposition, may be incorporated into the soil profile, redistributed or removed from a burned site within days or weeks by wind and water erosion to surface depressions, footslopes, streams, lakes, reservoirs and, potentially, into marine deposits.Research on the composition, properties and effects of ash on the burned ecosystem has been conducted on material collected in the field after wildland and prescribed fires as well as on material produced in the laboratory. At low combustion completeness (typically T{\textless}450°C), ash is organic-rich, with organic carbon as the main component. At high combustion completeness (T{\textgreater}450°C), most organic carbon is volatized and the remaining mineral ash has elevated pH when in solution. It is composed mainly of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, silicon and phosphorous in the form of inorganic carbonates, whereas at T{\textgreater}580°C the most common forms are oxides. Ash produced under lower combustion completeness is usually darker, coarser, and less dense and has a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than ash with higher combustion completeness, although physical reactions with CO2 and when moistened produce further changes in ash characteristics.As a new material present after a wildland fire, ash can have profound effects on ecosystems. It affects biogeochemical cycles, including the C cycle, not only within the burned area, but also globally. Ash incorporated into the soil increases temporarily soil pH and nutrient pools and changes physical properties such as albedo, soil texture and hydraulic properties including water repellency. Ash modifies soil hydrologic behavior by creating a two-layer system: the soil and the ash layer, which can function in different ways depending on (1) ash depth and type, (2) soil type and (3) rainfall characteristics. Key parameters are the ash's water holding capacity, hydraulic conductivity and its potential to clog soil pores. Runoff from burned areas carries soluble nutrients contained in ash, which can lead to problems for potable water supplies. Ash deposition also stimulates soil microbial activity and vegetation growth.Further work is needed to (1) standardize methods for investigating ash and its effects on the ecosystem, (2) characterize ash properties for specific ecosystems and wildland fire types, (3) determine the effects of ash on human and ecosystem health, especially when transported by wind or water, (4) investigate ash's controls on water and soil losses at slope and catchment scales, (5) examine its role in the C cycle, and (6) study its redistribution and fate in the environment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Radon in air was determined using modified alpha-scintillation cells under specified conditions in the sampling collection and nuclear track detectors in selected houses. The distribution of indoor radon levels has been found to be approximately log-normal with a geometric mean of 41.1 Bq??m-3 and a standard deviation of 3.0. The highest value of the radon concentration found was 15 400 Bq??m-3 In about 4{\%} of the houses, the radon concentration was found to be in excess of the recently recommended value of 400 Bq??m-3, suggested by the Commission of the European Communities (CEC). Elevated indoor levels were found to be more prevalent in the west and northwest than in the rest of the country.

abstract = {To investigate the effects of Spartina alterniflora on heavy metals pollution of intertidal sediments, sediment cores of a S. alterniflora salt marsh and a mudflat in Bohai Bay, China were analyzed. The results showed that S. alterniflora caused higher total C and P, but lower bulk density and electrical conductivity. The levels of Cd, Cu and Pb were higher in S. alterniflora sediment. Both Cd and Zn were higher than the probable effect level at both sites, indicating their toxicological importance. The geo-accumulation and potential ecological risk indexes revealed higher metal contamination in S. alterniflora sediment. Multivariate analysis implied that anthropogenic activities altered mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals. The percentage of mobile heavy metals was higher in S. alterniflora sediment, indicating improvement of conversion from the immobilized fraction to the mobilized fraction. These findings indicate that S. alterniflora may facilitate accumulation of heavy metals and increase their bioavailability and mobility. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The sudden and catastrophic, or slow and continuous, release at surface of naturally occurring toxic gases like CO2, H2S and Rn poses a serious health risk to people living in geologically active regions. In general this problem receives little attention from local governments, although public concern is raised periodically when anomalous toxic-gas concentrations suddenly kill humans or livestock. For example, elevated CO2 concentrations have been linked to the death of at least 10 people in the central Italian region of Lazio over the last 20 years, while it was the CO2 asphyxiation of 30 cows in a heavily populated area near Rome in 1999 which prompted the present soil-gas study into the distribution of the local health risk. A detailed geochemical survey was carried out in an area of about 4 km2 in the Ciampino and Marino districts, whereby a total of 274 soil-gas samples were collected and analysed for more than 10 major and trace gas species. Data were then processed using both statistical and geostatistical methods, and the resulting maps were examined in order to highlight areas of elevated risk. General trends of elevated CO2 and Rn concentrations imply the presence of preferential pathways (i.e. faults and fractures) along which deep gases are able to migrate towards the surface. The CO2 and Rn anomalous trends often correspond to and are usually elongated parallel to the Apennine mountain range, the controlling structural feature in central Italy. Because of this fundamental anisotropy in the factors controlling the soil-gas distribution, it was found that a geostatistical approach using variogram analysis allowed for a better interpretation of the data. With regard to the health risk to local inhabitants, it was found that although some high risk areas had been zoned as parkland, others had been heavily developed for residential purposes. For example, many new houses were found to have been built on ground which has soil-gas CO2 concentrations of more than 70{\%} and radon values of more than 250 kBq m-3. It is recommended that land-use planners incorporate soil-gas and/or gas flux measurements in environmental assessments in areas of possible risk (i.e. volcanic or structurally active areas). ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The focus of this study is an analysis of building vulnerability through investigating impacts from the 8 February 2013 flash flood event along the Avenida Venezuela channel in the city of Arequipa, Peru. On this day, 124.5mm of rain fell within 3h (monthly mean: 29.3mm) triggering a flash flood that inundated at least 0.4km2 of urban settlements along the channel, affecting more than 280 buildings, 23 of a total of 53 bridges (pedestrian, vehicle and railway), and leading to the partial collapse of sections of the main road, paralyzing central parts of the city for more than one week. This study assesses the aspects of building design and site specific environmental characteristics that render a building vulnerable by considering the example of a flash flood event in February 2013. A statistical methodology is developed that enables estimation of damage probability for buildings. The applied method uses observed inundation height as a hazard proxy in areas where more detailed hydrodynamic modeling data is not available. Building design and site-specific environmental conditions determine the physical vulnerability. The mathematical approach considers both physical vulnerability and hazard related parameters and helps to reduce uncertainty in the determination of descriptive parameters, parameter interdependency and respective contributions to damage. This study aims to (1) enable the estimation of damage probability for a certain hazard intensity, and (2) obtain data to visualize variations in damage susceptibility for buildings in flood prone areas. Data collection is based on a post-flood event field survey and the analysis of high (sub-metric) spatial resolution images (Pl{\'{e}}iades 2012, 2013). An inventory of 30 city blocks was collated in a GIS database in order to estimate the physical vulnerability of buildings. As many as 1103 buildings were surveyed along the affected drainage and 898 buildings were included in the statistical analysis. Univariate and bivariate analyses were applied to better characterize each vulnerability parameter. Multiple corresponding analyses revealed strong relationships between the “Distance to channel or bridges”, “Structural building type”, “Building footprint” and the observed damage. Logistic regression enabled quantification of the contribution of each explanatory parameter to potential damage, and determination of the significant parameters that express the damage susceptibility of a building. The model was applied 200 times on different calibration and validation data sets in order to examine performance. Results show that 90{\%} of these tests have a success rate of more than 67{\%}. Probabilities (at building scale) of experiencing different damage levels during a future event similar to the 8 February 2013 flash flood are the major outcomes of this study.},

abstract = {A systematic survey of soil CO2 concentrations was carried out on the flanks of Somma-Vesuvius volcano in order to constrain possible pathways responsible of carbon dioxide diffuse degassing taking place during the present state of quiescence. Measurements were performed at 1162 sites in late winter-spring 2000, highlighting that soil CO2 concentrations range from 50 to 10500 ppmV. A statistical analysis was developed in order to define the threshold value of anomaly and separate the biogenic CO2 component, produced by soil respiration, from the inorganic component of deep provenance. A computer routine was also elaborated to interpret the grid of CO2 anomalous concentration values and define the actual location, orientation and length of degassing structures. The results obtained by this procedure reveal a main control of the regional stress field on the patterns of gas migration. The identified degassing lineaments are typically oriented along the Apenninic (NW-SE) and anti-Apenninic (NE-SW) trends, which are known to govern the past geological and structural evolution of the Campanian Plain and present seismicity and deformation pattern of Mount Vesuvius. A main degassing area was recognized on the eastern and southern flanks of the volcano, which likely relates to the geometry of the underlying carbonate basement, reaching its top (500 m depth) in this sector of the volcano. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {CO2 and SO2 emission rates are reported for the volcanic gas plume from White Island, the most active volcano in New Zealand. SO2 emission rates were measured 16 times by correlation spectrometer (COSPEC) from 1986 to 1999 and range from 171 to 900 Mg day-1. We estimate the average SO2 emission rate was 430 ?? 70 Mg day-1 between 1983 and 1999. CO2 emission rates of 2570 and 2650 Mg day-1 were determined in January 1998 by aircraft directly in the plume using a CO2 analyzer and a ladder survey technique. Using the average SO2 emission rate and a CO2/S weight ratio of 3.6 previously reported for fumarole samples collected from the crater floor, an indirect estimate of the CO2 is 1550 Mg day-1. A soil gas survey of CO2 emissions from the crater floor gave an emission rate of 8.7 Mg day-1. Soil gases contribute less than 1{\%} of the total CO2 emitted from this volcano and show that the magmatic degassing of the underlying andesite magma is mostly isolated to the active crater and associated fumaroles. Volatile elements (H2O, Cl, F, S) were measured in melt inclusions trapped in plagioclase and clinopyroxene crystals. The low H2O contents (0.6 ?? 0.2 wt. {\%}) of melt inclusions suggest that crystal formation occurs at pressures of 35 to 70 bars. The Cl contents of melt inclusions (0.10-0.18 wt.{\%}) are higher than that of matrix glass (0.11 wt. {\%}), suggesting Cl was lost from the magma between the time of crystallization and eruption. Therefore, Cl degassing also occurred in part at shallow depths in the magmatic system. The low SO2 contents of both melt inclusions and matrix glass implies that it exsolves at depths greater than 300 m. CO2 is insoluble in andesitic magma and probably was degassing with SO2 at depths {\textgreater} 300 m within the magmatic system. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Diagnostic monitoring tools applied at different scales are required to reliably detect and assess CO2 leakages from storage formations in the shallow subsurface, as well as playing an important role in helping to establish a risk assessment strategy at carbon dioxide capture and storage facilities. These tools incorporate method developments and applications that will enable large spatial areas to be consistently covered in sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions. The use of remote sensing (open-path Fourier-transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy) in combination with regional measurements (geophysics and chamber based soil CO2 flux measurement) and local in situ measurements (Direct Push technology) enables a more reliable validation of risk, using a joint data interpretation approach. A promising tool currently in development for large-scale leakage detection and monitoring is Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which is used to determine spatial atmospheric CO2 distribution in the near-surface atmosphere. Sufficient geophysical techniques for meso-scale monitoring include geoelectrical and self potential (SP) surveys. These methods are useful for characterizing fluid flow and transport processes in permeable near-surface sedimentary layers and can yield important information concerning CO2 affected subsurface structures. The paper presents promising results achieved from measurements taken at a natural analogue site in the Czech Republic and indicates that the hierarchical monitoring approach represents a successful multidisciplinary modular concept to monitor physical and chemical processes taking place during CO2 migration and seepage. The application of FTIR spectroscopy in combination with soil gas surveys and geoelectrical investigations results in a comprehensive site characterization, including the atmospheric and near-surface CO2 distribution as well as subsurface structural features. Our data illustrate a correlation of higher CO2 concentration in the atmosphere with increased CO2 soil flux rates and soil CO2 concentrations. These soil gas anomalies coincide with structural units characterized by a distinct negative SP anomaly and a zone of decreased resistivity in the ERT result. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Analytical and numerical solutions for wave attenuation on the macro-scale for different bathymetries and coastal forest configurations are presented. For a transient incident wave, analytical results are discussed for the damping of a leading tsunami.

abstract = {A model is developed for calculation of the radon concentration in indoor air. The model takes into account various important parameters, e.g. radon concentration in ground, radon diffusion resistance of radon barrier, air permeance of ground, air pressure difference between outdoor ground and indoor at ground level, ventilation of the building ground and number of air changes per hour due to ventilation. Characteristic case studies are depicted in selected 2D and 3D graphical plots for easy visualization and interpretation. The radon transport into buildings might be dominated by diffusion, pressure driven flow or a mixture of both depending on the actual values of the various parameters. The results of our work indicate that with realistic or typical values of the parameters, most of the transport of radon from the building ground to the indoor air is due to air leakage driven by pressure differences through the construction. By incorporation of various and realistic values in the radon model, valuable information about the miscellaneous parameters influencing the indoor radon level is gained. Hence, the presented radon model may be utilized as a simple yet versatile and powerful tool for examining which preventive or remedial measures should be carried out to achieve an indoor radon level below the reference level as set by the authorities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

To minimise the number of new homes with this problem, building regulations require that all new homes built since July 1998 in high radon areas are installed with radon barriers during construction. Measurements on local authority homes in a number of high radon areas have allowed the impact of these new regulations to be assessed. In County Cork a reduction of up to 70{\%} in the mean radon concentration was observed in homes built since 1998 relative to those built before this date. A reduction in both the number of homes exceeding the reference level and the maximum concentration measured in homes was also measured. Homes exceeding the reference level were remediated with the use of an active sump. The results of this remedial work are also presented and show that the mean reduction in radon concentration achieved was 92{\%}.},

Although the possible adverse effects that immigration can have on the wage and employment levels of natives are typically examined, immigra- tion may also have a role to play in raising skill levels. This leads to the second broad issue: the effect of migration of a particular skill composition on the long-term (endoge- nous) growth of the host country. Finally, immigration can have a major economic im- pact on the source country.

abstract = {At Vesuvio, a significant fraction of the rising hydrothermal-volcanic fluids is subjected to a condensation and separation process producing a CO2-rich gas phase, mainly expulsed through soil diffuse degassing from well defined areas called diffuse degassing structures (DDS), and a liquid phase that flows towards the outer part of the volcanic cone. A large amount of thermal energy is associated with the steam condensation process and subsequent cooling of the liquid phase. The total amount of volcanic-hydrothermal CO2 discharged through diffuse degassing has been computed through a sequential Gaussian simulation (sGs) approach based on several hundred accumulation chamber measurements and, at the time of the survey, amounted to 151 t d(-1). The steam associated with the CO2 output, computed assuming that the original H2O/CO2 ratio of hydrothermal fluids is preserved in fumarolic effluents, is 553 t d(-1), and the energy produced by the steam condensation and cooling of the liquid phase is 1.47x10(12) J d(-1) (17 MW). The location of the CO2 and temperature anomalies show that most of the gas is discharged from the inner part of the crater and suggests that crater morphology and local stratigraphy exert strong control on CO2 degassing and subsurface steam condensation. The amounts of gas and energy released by Vesuvio are comparable to those released by other volcanic degassing areas of the world and their estimates, through periodic surveys Of Soil CO2 flux, can constitute a useful tool to monitor volcanic activity.},

With Supplement 6(1), the title of the series was modified from IARC Monographs on the Evaluation a/the Carcinagenic Risk ofChemicals ta Humans to IARC Monographs on the Evaluation o/Carcinogenic Risks ta Humans, in order to reflect the widened scope of the programme. The criteria established in 1971 to evaluate carcinogenic risk to humans were adopted by the working groups whose deliberations resulted in the first 16 volumes of the IARC Monographs series. Those criteria were subsequently re-evaluated by working groups which met in 1977(2), 1978(3), 1979(4), 1982(5) and 1983(6).

Nevertheless, direct evidence of risk from residential radon is desirable. In 1990, a study was started comprising 12000 inhabitants of an area with elevated radon concentrations. The mean level in the houses was higher than general mean of the country by a factor of five. In the period 1961-1995, a total of 173 lung cancers were observed. Comparing to nationally expected numbers (E), the observed number (O) of cases is elevated (O/E=1.11), in contrast to generally low figures for cancers other than lung (O/E=0.85). Lung cancer risk related to cumulative exposures experienced in the past 5-24 or 5-35 years were both significant. In relation to standard radon progeny concentration 100 Bq/m3, the excess relative risk coefficient was 0.103 (95{\%} CI, 0.039-0.168), the value somewhat lower than findings in other indoor studies.

@article{Holloway2006,
abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is an option in the portfolio of actions that could be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the continued use of fossil fuels. At its simplest, the CCS process is a chain consisting of three major steps: the capture and compression of CO2 (usually at a large industrial installation1 ), its transport to a storage location and its long-term isolation from the atmosphere. IPCC (2005) has produced a Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (SRCCS), from which additional information on CCS can be obtained. The material in these Guidelines has been produced in consultation with the authors of the SRCCS. Geological storage can take place in natural underground reservoirs such as oil and gas fields, coal seams and saline water-bearing formations utilizing natural geological barriers to isolate the CO2 from the atmosphere. A description of the storage processes involved is given in Chapter 5 of the SRCCS. Geological CO2 storage may take place either at sites where the sole purpose is CO2 storage, or in tandem with enhanced oil recovery, enhanced gas recovery or enhanced coalbed methane recovery operations (EOR, EGR and ECBM respectively). These Guidelines provide emission estimation guidance for carbon dioxide transport, injection and geological storage (CCGS) only. No emissions estimation methods are provided for any other type of storage option such as ocean storage or conversion of CO2 into inert inorganic carbonates. With the exception of the mineral carbonation of certain waste materials, these technologies are at the research stage rather than the demonstration or later stages of technological development IPCC (2005). If and when they reach later stages of development, guidance for compiling inventories of emissions from these technologies may be given in future revisions of the Guidelines. Emissions resulting from fossil fuels used for capture, compression, transport, and injection of CO2, are not addressed in this chapter. Those emissions are included and reported in the national inventory as energy use in the appropriate stationary or mobile energy use categories. Fuel use by ships engaged in international transport will be excluded where necessary by the bunker rules, whatever the cargo, and it is undesirable to extend the bunker provisions to emissions from any energy used in operating pipelines.},

abstract = {Geological sequestration of CO2 in depleted oil reservoirs is a potentially useful strategy for greenhouse gas management and can be combined with enhanced oil recovery. Development of methods to estimate CO2 leakage rates is essential to assure that storage objectives are being met at sequestration facilities. Perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs) were added as three 12 h slugs at about one week intervals during the injection of 2090 tons of CO2 into the West Pearl Queen (WPQ) depleted oil formation, sequestration pilot study site located in SE New Mexico. The CO2 was injected into the Permian Queen Formation. Leakage was monitored in soil-gas using a matrix of 40 capillary adsorbent tubes (CATs) left in the soil for periods ranging from days to months. The tracers, perfluoro-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (PDCH), perfluorotrimethylcyclohexane (PTCH) and perfluorodimethylcyclobutane (PDCB), were analyzed using thermal desorption, and gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Monitoring was designed to look for immediate leakage, such as at the injection well bore and at nearby wells, and to develop the technology to estimate overall CO2 leak rates based on the use of PFTs. Tracers were detected in soil-gas at the monitoring sites 50 m from the injection well within days of injection. Tracers continued to escape over the following years. Leakage appears to have emanated from the vicinity of the injection well in a radial pattern to about 100 m and in directional patterns to 300 m. Leakage rates were estimated for the 3 tracers from each of the 4 sets of CATs in place following the start of CO2 injection. Leakage was fairly uniform during this period. As a first approximation, the CO2 leak rate was estimated at about 0.0085{\%} of the total CO2 sequestered per annum.},

The results revealed higher concentrations of heavy metals in topsoil samples than in sub-surface samples. The samples from IS1, IS2, and IS3, located in the Talcahuano industrial park, had higher Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn contents than did samples from the other sites. This was probably due to local pollution by industrial (metallurgical) dust, although other diffuse pollution throughout the entire port region (shipyards, metallurgy, the dismantling of old ships), and contributions from the wind from adjacent industrial, storage, and vessel areas clearly played a role. Heavy metals were lowest in the sample taken on school grounds (SG).},

abstract = {Geological storage of CO 2 in the offshore Gippsland Basin, Australia, is being investigated by the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) as a possible method for storing the very large volumes of CO 2 emissions from the nearby Latrobe Valley area. A storage capacity of about 50 million tonnes of CO 2 per annum for a 40-year injection period is required, which will necessitate several individual storage sites to be used both sequentially and simultaneously, but timed such that existing hydrocarbon assets will not be compromised. Detailed characterisation focussed on the Kingfish Field area as the first site to be potentially used, in the anticipation that this oil field will be depleted within the period 2015–2025. The potential injection targets are the interbedded sandstones of the Paleocene-Eocene upper Latrobe Group, regionally sealed by the Lakes Entrance Formation. The research identified several features to the offshore Gippsland Basin that make it particularly favourable for CO 2 storage. These include: a complex stratigraphic architecture that provides baffles which slow vertical migration and increase residual gas trapping and dissolution; non-reactive reservoir units that have high injectivity; a thin, suitably reactive, lower permeability marginal reservoir just below the regional seal providing mineral trapping; several depleted oil fields that provide storage capacity coupled with a transient production-induced flow regime that enhances containment; and long migration pathways beneath a competent regional seal. This study has shown that the Gippsland Basin has sufficient capacity to store very large volumes of CO 2 . It may provide a solution to the problem of substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions from future coal developments in the Latrobe Valley.},

On the basis of the {\{}CO2/H2O{\}} ratio measured in high-temperature fumaroles inside the degassing area, we computed a total thermal energy flux of 1.19*1013 J d−1 (138 {\{}MW).{\}} Most of this energy is lost by shallow steam condensation and transferred to the atmosphere through the hot soil of the degassing area. The thermal energy released by diffuse degassing at Solfatara is by far the main way of energy release from the whole Campi Flegrei caldera. It is 1 order of magnitude higher than the conductive heat flux through the entire caldera, and, during the last 20 years, it was several times higher than the energy associated with seismic crises and ground deformation events. It is possible that changes in the energy flux from a magma body seated underneath Solfatara and/or argillification processes at relatively shallow depths determine pressurization events in the hydrothermal system and consequently ground deformation and shallow seismic swarms, as recorded during the recent episodes of volcanic unrest centered at Pozzuoli.},

abstract = {New high-resolution aeromagnetic data from the Caledonides and Archaean–Palaeoproterozoic crystalline basement of Finnmark and North Troms derived from surveys conducted as part of NGU's MINN programme provide spectacular and confirmatory evidence for the continuation of diverse, Precambrian greenstone belts and granulite terranes beneath the magnetically transparent Caledonian nappes. Complementary airborne radiometric data collected in the same survey contribute to the analytical process and to an evaluation of the mineral potential in the area. Some parts of existing data have also been reprocessed using new techniques and software to reach the same level as the newly acquired data. The new compiled data provide images of the magnetic field at sufficiently high resolution to allow us to examine finer details of the bedrock geology. One of the principal outcomes of the analysis is a picture of the detailed structural fabric of the region provided by images of tilt derivatives of the magnetic field that enhance anomalies. This fabric is an important framework for developing exploration strategies. Patterns and other characteristics of the magnetic field have been used to revise positions of some geological boundaries, especially in poorly exposed areas, and delineate specific domains within northern Norway. Radiometric data have been used to supplement the magnetic interpretations in some cases. In general, there is a good correlation between the radiometric data and magnetic anomaly maps which can be utilised to re-evaluate the geological boundaries. Several such features of interest are discussed. As an example, NW–SE-trending, fault-bounded terranes or belts which extend from Finnmark and Troms through northern Finland, Sweden and Russia can be easily followed on the high-resolution data. In this contribution, all the main geological terranes from the Archaean–Palaeoproterozoic belt to the Caledonian nappes in northern Norway will be discussed in relation to their magnetic patterns and radiometric anomalies.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that geological emissions of methane are an important greenhouse-gas source. Remarkable amounts of methane, estimated in the order of 40-60 Tg yr-1, are naturally released into the atmosphere from the Earth's crust through faults and fractured rocks. The main source is natural gas, both microbial and thermogenic, produced in hydrocarbon-prone sedimentary basins and injected into the atmosphere through macro-seeps (onshore and offshore mud volcanoes and other seeps) and microseepage, an invisible but pervasive flux from the soil. This source is now evaluated for Europe on the basis of a literature survey, new field measurements and derived emission factors. The up-scaling criteria recommended by the EMEP/CORINAIR guidelines are applied to the local point and area source data. In Europe, 25 countries host oil and/or natural gas reservoirs and potentially, or actually, emit geological methane. Flux data, however, are available only from 10 countries: the onshore or offshore petroliferous sectors of Denmark, Italy, Greece, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Black Sea countries (Bulgaria, Ukraine, Georgia). Azerbaijan, whose emissions due to mud volcanism are known to be relevant, is included in the estimate. The sum of emissions, regional estimates and local measurements, related to macro-seeps leads to a conservative total value of about 2.2 Tg yr-1. Together with the potential microseepage fluxes from the petroliferous basins, estimated on the basis of the Total Petroleum System concept (around 0.8 Tg yr-1), the total European seepage is projected to 3 Tg yr-1. This preliminary figure would represent, in terms of magnitude, the second natural methane source for Europe after wetlands. The estimate will have to be refined by increasing the number of seepage measurements both on lands, where there is high potential for microseepage (e.g., Germany, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Georgia) and in coastal marine areas (the North Sea, the Black Sea, offshore Greece and Italy) where emission factors and the extent of the underwater seeping area are not completely known. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The influence of the environment and environmental change is largely unrepresented in standard theories of migration, whilst recent debates on climate change and migration focus almost entirely on displacement and perceive migration to be a problem. Drawing on an increasing evidence base that has assessed elements of the influence of the environment on migration, this paper presents a new framework for understanding the effect of environmental change on migration. The framework identifies five families of drivers which affect migration decisions: economic, political, social, demographic and environmental drivers. The environment drives migration through mechanisms characterised as the availability and reliability of ecosystem services and exposure to hazard. Individual migration decisions and flows are affected by these drivers operating in combination, and the effect of the environment is therefore highly dependent on economic, political, social and demographic context. Environmental change has the potential to affect directly the hazardousness of place. Environmental change also affects migration indirectly, in particular through economic drivers, by changing livelihoods for example, and political drivers, through affecting conflicts over resources, for example. The proposed framework, applicable to both international and internal migration, emphasises the role of human agency in migration decisions, in particular the linked role of family and household characteristics on the one hand, and barriers and facilitators to movement on the other in translating drivers into actions. The framework can be used to guide new research, assist with the evaluation of policy options, and provide a context for the development of scenarios representing a range of plausible migration futures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Marine animals are mostly affected through entanglement in and ingestion of plastic litter.

Less conspicuous forms, such as plastic pellets and "scrubbers" are also hazardous.

abstract = {Extensive research has focused on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. However, in Mediterranean ecosystems, soil respiration may have a pulsed response to precipitation events, especially during prolonged dry periods. Here, we investigate temporal variations in soil respiration (Rs), soil temperature (T) and soil water content (SWC) under three different land uses (a forest area, an abandoned agricultural field and a rainfed olive grove) in a dry Mediterranean area of southeast Spain, and evaluate the relative importance of soil temperature and water content as predictors of Rs. We hypothesize that soil moisture content, rather than soil temperature, becomes the major factor controlling CO2 efflux rates in this Mediterranean ecosystem during the summer dry season. Soil CO2 efflux was measured monthly between January 2006 and December 2007 using a portable soil respiration instrument fitted with a soil respiration chamber (LI-6400-09). Mean annual soil respiration rates were 2.06 ± 0.07, 1.71 ± 0.09, and 1.12 ± 0.12 $\mu$mol m-2 s-1 in the forest, abandoned field and olive grove, respectively. Rs was largely controlled by soil temperature above a soil water content threshold value of 10{\%} at 0-15 cm depth for forest and olive grove, and 15{\%} for abandoned field. However, below those thresholds Rs was controlled by soil moisture. Exponential and linear models adequately described Rs responses to environmental variables during the growing and dry seasons. Models combining abiotic (soil temperature and soil rewetting index) and biotic factors (above-ground biomass index and/or distance from the nearest tree) explained between 39 and 73{\%} of the temporal variability of Rs in the forest and olive grove. However, in the abandoned field, a single variable - either soil temperature (growing season) or rewetting index (dry season) - was sufficient to explain between 51 and 63{\%} of the soil CO2 efflux. The fact that the rewetting index, rather than soil water content, became the major factor controlling soil CO2 efflux rates during the prolonged summer drought emphasizes the need to quantify the effects of rain pulses in estimates of net annual carbon fluxes from soil in Mediterranean ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {AbstractThe flow regime of rivers is a complex but important measure of environmental quality and one that can be significantly impacted by conventional hydropower generation. While traditional hydropower scheduling creates a periodicity in downstream flows corresponding to seasonal and daily electricity demand patterns, deregulated electricity markets may provide financial incentives to further alter flows, as utilities respond to hourly market dynamics. This study investigates the potential for deregulated markets to impact both a hydropower utility's revenue stream and downstream flow regimes. Six operating scenarios are explored: (1–2) full-market participation (including real-time energy), with and without flow reregulation; (3) day-ahead market only; and (4–6) run-of-river operations (ROR), with and without flood control and flow reregulation. Results suggest that, relative to a day-ahead-only scenario, the scale of any differences in flow regime resulting from full-market participation is relatively small compared to the additional revenue-generating potential of such a strategy. Implementing a run-of-river policy frequently yields “more natural” flow regimes than the day-ahead only scenario; but, in some cases these improvements are modest, and in others the ROR scenarios exacerbate deviation from unregulated flows. Regardless, the effects of implementing an ROR strategy come at a substantial cost in terms of foregone hydropower revenue.},

abstract = {So far, the role of present-day Earth degassing in global C budget and climate effects has been focused to volcanic emissions. The non-volcanic escape of CO2-CH4 from the upper mantle, from carbonate bearing rocks in the crust, from hydrocarbon accumulations and from surface deposits and processes is here discussed in detail. An inventory of recent available data is presented. For the first time, a so large quantity of data is considered altogether showing clearly that the geological flux of carbon was previously significantly underestimated. Several lines of evidence show that non-volcanic C fluxes in «colder» environments are much greater than generally assumed. Local and regional data suggest that metamorphic decarbonation, hydrocarbon leakage and mud volcanoes could be significant CO2-CH4 sources at global scale. Moreover, extensive surface gas-geochemical observations, including soil - atmosphere flux investigations, open the possibility that ecosystems controlled by biogenic activity (soil, permafrost, seawater) can host important components of endogenous C gas (geogas), even in the absence of surface gas manifestations. This would imply the existence of a geological diffuse, background emission over large areas of our planet. New theories concerning the occurrence of pervasive geogas and lithospheric processes of C-gas production («dithospheric loss in rigidity») can be taken as novel reference and rationale for re-evaluating geological sources of CO2 and CH4, and an important endeavour and work prospect for the years to come. Our survey shows that it is still very hard to arrive at a meaningful estimate of the lithospheric non-volcanic degassing into the atmosphere. Orders of 102-103 Mt CO2/year can be provisionally considered. Assuming as lower limit for a global subaerial volcanic degassing 300 Mt/year, the lithosphere may emit directly into the atmosphere at least 600 Mt CO2/year (about 10{\%} of the C source due to deforestation and land-use exchange), an estimate we still consider conservative. It is likely that temporal variations of lithosphere degassing, at Quaternary and secular scale, may influence the atmospheric C budget. The present-day lithosphere degassing would seem higher than the value considered to balance at Ma time-scale the CO2 uptake due to silicate weathering. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Otway Project is Australia's first demonstration project and is well underway with injection having started in April 2008 and over 23,000 tonnes of CO2 injected by the end of September. Project activities commenced in late 2004 and being the first, faced significant regulatory and execution challenges. In 2005, the emphasis was on feasibility and project development. Following a rigorous technical and consultative approach, the project regulatory permitting process was defined, the site characterisation and risk assessment started and the field implementation organization defined. In 2006 the project focused on reducing the uncertainties and following Front End Engineering Development (FEED) process as part of seeking approval for major expenses. Several technical challenges were faced and dealt with in finalising the new injection well location and the plant design. The monitoring and verification plan was defined and data acquisition for the pre-injection atmospheric, soil gas and water chemistry characteristics started. In 2007, the project entered the execution phase with the successful drilling of a new injection well. A rich data set of cores and logs was collected enhancing the reservoir model and dynamic simulations. Monitoring activities continued and a 3D surfaceseismic and vertical seismic profile (VSP) acquired concurrently to define the pre injection baseline. Through a complex workover operation, the observation well was equipped with an integrated geophysical and geochemical sensor assembly to facilitate collecting monitoring data during injection. Surface installations, such as the process plant and the pipeline were constructed and the system commissioned in readiness to commence injection. At each stage the project faced several non-technical and technical challenges. In overcoming these, valuable insights have been gained and lessons learnt. These have been incorporated in the proposed Australian legislation on CCS and planning for future projects. To date the project has been positively received by the community. Injection has commenced and supported by a rigorous monitoring and modeling program, is well on its way towards gaining public acceptance for CCS under Australian conditions, through a comprehensive community consultation program and safe and successful operations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Metals emitted this way are generally bound in small particles with the potential for atmospheric long-range transport and contamination. Sediments are the ultimate sink for metals emitted to the aquatic environment; this is most evident in coastal and estuarine sediments. Besides direct emissions, man-made environmental changes such as acidification, oxygen depletion, and draining of waterlogged areas may mobilize metals not otherwise available to organisms. The speciation of metals is an important determinant for their bioavailability, uptake, and toxicity in the environment. Organisms have developed a wide range of mechanisms for the internal handling and storage of essential and/or toxic metals. No metal other than mercury is consistently biomagnified along food chains. In the environment, the most adverse impacts of metals (on populations) have been caused by organic tin compounds used in antifouling paints and aluminum mobilized by acid rain. High concentrations of organic mercury and cadmium in certain organisms may cause concerns for the health of human populations that rely heavily on their use as food items.},

abstract = {The morphology, mineralogy, and magnetic properties of technogenic magnetic particles (TMPs) were analysed in four kinds of industrial dust produced during high temperature technological processes of different branches of industry (lignite and hard coal burning, cement production, coke production). The study was carried out by means of magnetic susceptibility measurement, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction, M??ssbauer spectroscopy, and thermomagnetic analysis. To assess the total content of the magnetic fraction in bulk dust samples, mass specific magnetic susceptibility (??) was measured and then a physical separation of magnetic particles (mostly of technogenic origin) was conducted. The dusts revealed high diversity of the ?? value, which was dependent on the magnetic particles' concentration and mineralogical composition. Significant differences in the magnetic mineralogy of dusts coming from different branches of industry were observed. In fly ashes from coal combustion, spherical forms (typical ferromagnetic spherules) of magnetite, magnesioferrite, and maghemite were mostly observed. In dusts after lignite combustion a higher content of antiferromagnetic hematite and maghemite was observed due to the lower temperature of lignite combustion. In cement dusts a large variety of iron minerals were observed including magnetite, maghemite, hematite, ferrites, and goethite. The characteristic mineral forms for cement dusts were Ca-ferrites and co-occurrence of calcite, anhydrite, gypsum, and bassanite with a magnetic mineral fraction. The magnetic fraction produced by the coke industry was mostly in the form of tightly compacted aggregates with well-formed crystal structures where ferromagnetic pyrrhotite was characteristic feature. The TMPs could be distinctive for pollution source identification and serve as a tracer of dust origin and (if found in topsoil) identification of soil pollution sources. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Natural hydrocarbon gas seeps are surface expressions of Petroleum Seepage Systems, whereby gas is ascending through faults from pressurized reservoirs that are typically associated with sandstones or limestones. A spectacular " eternal flame" in western New York State marks a gas macroseep of dominantly thermogenic origin emanating directly from deep shale source rocks, which makes this a rare case in contrast to most Petroleum Seepage Systems where gas derives from conventional reservoirs.The main flaming seep releases about 1 kg of methane per day and may feature the highest ethane and propane (C2 + C3) concentration ever reported for a natural gas seep (∼35 vol. {\%}). The same gas is also released to the atmosphere through nearby invisible and diffuse seepages from the ground. The synopsis of our data with available gas-geochemical data of reservoir gases in the region and the stratigraphy of underlying shales suggests that the thermogenic gas originates from Upper Devonian shales without intermediation of a conventional reservoir. A similar investigation on a second " eternal flame" in Pennsylvania suggests that gas is migrating from a conventional sandstone pool and that the seep is probably not natural but results from an undocumented and abandoned gas or oil well. The large flux of the emitted shale gas in New York State implies the existence of a pressurized gas pool at depth. Tectonically fractured shales seem to express " naturally fracked" characteristics and may provide convenient targets for hydrocarbon exploration. Gas production from " tectonically fracked" systems might not require extensive artificial fracking. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The aim of the survey was to identify risk zones characterised by high levels of this radioactive gas. Radon measurements were made at the depth of 50 cm, in the ground according to a systematic grid pattern. Furthermore, at all 48 measurement points, the surface gamma dose rates in the air was also measured at the same locations and soil samples were collected for gamma spectrometric analysis for the radionuclides 226Ra, 228Th and 40K. Radon concentrations were found to range from 1270 to 155 000 Bq m- 3 with an average of 33 765 Bq m- 3 and a median value of 12 626 Bq m- 3. The geometrical mean value and geometrical standard deviation were calculated as 16 160 Bq m- 3 and 3.5 Bq m- 3, respectively. Gamma dose rate varies from 92 to 316 nGy h- 1, with an average of 132 nGy h- 1. The radium content in collected soil samples ranges from 24 to 1810 Bq kg- 1 with an average of 187 Bq kg- 1. High correlations (r2 {\textgreater} 0.8) between soil gas radon concentration, gamma dose rate and 226Ra content in soil were found for each pair.

abstract = {The presence of microplastics in the marine environment poses a great threat to the entire ecosystem and has received much attention lately as the presence has greatly impacted oceans, lakes, seas, rivers, coastal areas and even the Polar Regions. Microplastics are found in most commonly utilized products (primary microplastics), or may originate from the fragmentation of larger plastic debris (secondary microplastics). The material enters the marine environment through terrestrial and land-based activities, especially via runoffs and is known to have great impact on marine organisms as studies have shown that large numbers of marine organisms have been affected by microplastics. Microplastic particles have been found distributed in large numbers in Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia, India, South Africa, North America, and in Europe. This review describes the sources and global distribution of microplastics in the environment, the fate and impact on marine biota, especially the food chain. Furthermore, the control measures discussed are those mapped out by both national and international environmental organizations for combating the impact from microplastics. Identifying the main sources of microplastic pollution in the environment and creating awareness through education at the public, private, and government sectors will go a long way in reducing the entry of microplastics into the environment. Also, knowing the associated behavioral mechanisms will enable better understanding of the impacts for the marine environment. However, a more promising and environmentally safe approach could be provided by exploiting the potentials of microorganisms, especially those of marine origin that can degrade microplastics. Capsule The concentration, distribution sources and fate of microplastics in the global marine environment were discussed, so also was the impact of microplastics on a wide range of marine biota.},

abstract = {This paper provides a review of the classification of travertines with emphasis on their morphology. Three criteria are used to describe them: geochemistry, microfabric and morphology. Geochemically, travertines may be divided into two groups, the meteogene travertines, where the carrier carbon dioxide originates in the soil and epigean atmosphere, and the thermal (thermogene) travertines where the carbon dioxide comes from thermally generated sources. Many travertine fabrics are influenced by bacteria and plants. These include 'stromatolitic' forms, many oncoids, shrubs, tufts, mats and moss travertines. Morphologically, travertines are conveniently divided into autochthonous (spring mounds and ridges, cascades, barrages, fluvial and lacustrine crusts, paludal deposits and cemented rudites) and the allochthonous or clastic travertines (valley-fills, back-barrage deposits, alluvial cones). Travertine deposits often include a wide range of fabrics and morphologies in one system. They are influenced locally by discharge, slope, vegetation, climate and human activity. Intergradations occur, both within travertine types but also with other freshwater deposits, e.g. calcrete and lake chalk. The influence of travertine deposition on the local hydrology and geomorphology is also discussed. The review emphasises the significance of scale and hydrology and aims to provide a unified scheme of travertine classification.

The volcanological history of Lipari was reconstructed defining two stages (pre-and post-erosive stages) further on subdivided in four volcanic phases, each of which characterized by products with a particular chemical composition and separated by stratigraphic unconformities. The correlations between petrographic features, determined by X-ray fluorescence, and volcanological history of the island highlight a gradual differentiation with younger rocks showing a more acid chemical composition than the older ones. Radiometric features, and in particular the content of primordial radionuclides 238U, 232Th and 40K, have been measured through gamma-ray spectrometry with hyper-pure germanium detector. The different volcanic lithologies, such as basalts, andesites and rhyolites, have been characterized by petrographic diagrams. The calculated dose rate has also been used as an additional classification parameter. Older products show low alkali content than the younger ones. This is related with the increasing of incompatible elements, such as uranium and thorium, in the younger products. Principal components and hierarchical clustering statistical analyses have provided additional information on sample differentiation and similarities. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the process of mapping indoor radon risk, an important step is to define geological units well-correlated with indoor radon. The present paper examines this question for the Walloon region of Belgium, using a database of more than 18,000 indoor radon measurements. With a few exceptions like the Carboniferous (to be divided into Tournaisian, Visean and Namurian-Westphalian) and the Tertiary (in which all Series may be treated together), the Series/Epoch stratigraphic level is found to be the most appropriate geological unit to classify the radon risk. A further division according to the geological massif or region is necessary to define units with a reasonable uniformity of the radon risk. In particular, Paleozoic series from Cambrian to Devonian show strong differences between different massifs. Local hot-spots are also observed in the Brabant massif. Finally, 35 geological units are defined according to their radon risk, 6 of which still present a clear weak homogeneity. In the case of 4 of these units (Jurassic, Middle Devonian of Condroz and of Fagne-Famenne, Ordovician of the Stavelot massif) homogeneity is moderate, but the data are strongly inhomogeneous for Visean in Condroz and in the Brabant massif. The 35 geological units are used in an ANOVA analysis, to evaluate the part of indoor radon variability which can be attributed to geology. The result (15.4-17.7{\%}) agrees with the values observed in the UK. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The Basic Safety Standard (BSS) Directive 2013/59/EURATOM of the European Union (EU) has stated the need for member states to establish national action plans to mitigate their general population's long-term risks of exposure to radon gas. Maps of radon-prone areas provide a useful tool for the development of such plans. This paper presents the maps of radon-prone areas in the Eastern Canary Islands (Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote) obtained from assessment of Geogenic Radon Potential (GRP) distribution in the territory. GRP constitutes a magnitude that is contingent on both radon activity concentration and gas permeability of soils. An extensive campaign covering all geological formations of the Eastern Canary Islands was undertaken to locally sample these parameters. Geostatistical analysis of the spatial distribution of radon concentration in soils, permeability and GRP was performed on each of the islands, and the relationship between these magnitudes and the characteristic geological formations of the volcanic islands was investigated. Areas dominated by basic volcanic and plutonic rocks (originated by both recent and ancient volcanism) exhibit relatively low levels of radon in soils, and with the exception of specific cases of very high permeability, these areas are not classified as prone to radon risk according to international criteria. Areas in which intermediate or acidic volcanic and plutonic rocks predominate are characterised by greater radon activity concentration in soils, rendering them radon-prone. Given these results, Lanzarote is classified as an island with low radon risk all over its surface; Fuerteventura presents low-medium risk; and Gran Canaria contains extensive areas in the centre and north where the risk is medium or high. This classification is consistent with the risk maps obtained by National and European agencies from indoor radon measurements conducted on these islands.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is being injected into geological storage sites around the world at both pilot and commercial scales. A variety of monitoring technologies are employed at these sites ultimately with the aim of demonstrating storage integrity both at the current time and also into the future. This paper reviews selected monitoring technologies employed at two pilot-scale and two commercial sites. At the pilot-scale CO2 injection site at Ketzin (Germany), preliminary analysis of electrical resistivity measurements indicate the presence of injected CO2 between the injection and monitoring wells. At Nagaoka, a pilot-scale CO2 injection site in Japan, a suite of time-lapse wireline logs (including resistivity, neutron and sonic) were used to monitor injected CO2. Resistivity readings increased in the injected formation and later decreased particularly in the layers below. This decrease was attributed to CO2 dissolving in the formation water implying that the site is moving towards increased storage stability. Satellite-based monitoring is being used at the onshore commercial-scale CO2 injection site at In Salah, Algeria, to monitor millimetre-scale ground displacement as a result of CO2 injection. The displacement rates show a NW-SE trend, mirroring the known structure of the area, suggesting a structural control on the subsurface distribution of the CO2. Sleipner is a commercial CO2 injection site in the North Sea which has been in operation since 1996. Results of time-lapse (4D) seismic surveys over the site clearly show the migration of the CO2 plume in the subsurface. The results add to the portfolio of successful fit for purpose CO2 storage monitoring techniques.},

This paper examines the impact of applying various epidemiologic dosimetry models for radon exposure assessment using a common data set from the Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study (IRLCS). The IRLCS uniquely combined enhanced dosimetric techniques, individual mobility assessment, and expert histologic review to examine the relationship between cumulative radon exposure, smoking, and lung cancer. The a priori defined IRLCS radon-exposure model produced higher odds ratios than those methodologies that did not link the subject's retrospective mobility with multiple, spatially diverse radon concentrations. In addition, the smallest measurement errors were noted for the IRLCS exposure model. Risk estimates based solely on basement radon measurements generally exhibited the lowest risk estimates and the greatest measurement error. The findings indicate that the power of an epidemiologic study to detect an excess risk from residential radon exposure is enhanced by linking spatially disparate radon concentrations with the subject's retrospective mobility.},

abstract = {Chemical (major and trace elements) and isotopic compositions (??D and ??18O in waters and ??13C in CO2 and 3He/4He in gases) of natural thermal (11) and cold (39) fluids (spring waters and gases) discharging from a tectonic window of Mesozoic limestones in central Italy, have proved to be the result of mixing processes inside the limestone formations. The limestones provide a preferential route for subsurface fluid migration and they gather both descending cold, Ca-HCO3, B-depleted groundwaters and rising convective Ca-SO4(HCO3), CO2-saturated, B-rich thermal waters. Atmospherically-derived descending gas components (N2, Ne, He), dissolved in rainfall that infiltrates the limestone system mix with N2, Ne, He-depleted hot rising waters. Boron in the liquid phase and N2 and Ne in the gas phase are the most useful elements to trace the mixing process. The deeper gas samples recognised in the area are associated with the hotter waters emerging in the area. In spite of being depleted in Ne and He and light hydrocarbons they have the higher measured 3He/4He ratios, suggesting a contribution of mantle 3He to the gas phase. This contrasts with deep circulation in the crust which would lead to increased concentration of 4He in the deeper gases. Paradoxically, there is more relative concentration of 4He in the more air-contaminated gas samples than in the deeper gas samples. A similar paradox exists when the ??13C of CO2 in the deeper gas samples is considered. The shallower air-contaminated gas samples, although they should be affected by the addition of soil-13C depleted organic C, have ??13C in CO2 more positive than the deeper gas samples recognized. Since any deep hydrothermal source of CO2 should generate CO2 with more positive values of ??13C than those measured at surface, a multiple (single) calcite precipitation process from hydrothermal solutions, with C isotopic fractionation along the rising path inside the Mesozoic limestone formations, is proposed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {A new approach is presented for analysis of microplastics in environmental samples, based on selective fluorescent staining using Nile Red (NR), followed by density-based extraction and filtration. The dye adsorbs onto plastic surfaces and renders them fluorescent when irradiated with blue light. Fluorescence emission is detected using simple photography through an orange filter. Image-analysis allows fluorescent particles to be identified and counted. Magnified images can be recorded and tiled to cover the whole filter area, allowing particles down to a few micrometres to be detected. The solvatochromic nature of Nile Red also offers the possibility of plastic categorisation based on surface polarity characteristics of identified particles. This article details the development of this staining method and its initial cross-validation by comparison with infrared (IR) microscopy. Microplastics of different sizes could be detected and counted in marine sediment samples. The fluorescence staining identified the same particles as those found by scanning a filter area with IR-microscopy.},

abstract = {Context. The variable Sun is the most likely candidate for the natural forcing of past climate changes on time scales of 50 to 1000 years. Evidence for this understanding is that the terrestrial climate correlates positively with the solar activity. During the past 10 000 years, the Sun has experienced the substantial variations in activity and there have been numerous attempts to reconstruct solar irradiance. While there is general agreement on how solar forcing varied during the last several hundred years – all reconstructions are proportional to the solar activity – there is scientific controversy on the magnitude of solar forcing. Aims. We present a reconstruction of the total and spectral solar irradiance covering 130 nm–10 $\mu$m from 1610 to the present with an annual resolution and for the Holocene with a 22-year resolution. Methods. We assume that the minimum state of the quiet Sun in time corresponds to the observed quietest area on the present Sun. Then we use available long-term proxies of the solar activity, which are 10Be isotope concentrations in ice cores and 22-year smoothed neutron monitor data, to interpolate between the present quiet Sun and the minimum state of the quiet Sun. This determines the long-term trend in the solar variability, which is then superposed with the 11-year activity cycle calculated from the sunspot number. The time-dependent solar spectral irradiance from about 7000 BC to the present is then derived using a state-of-the-art radiation code. Results. We derive a total and spectral solar irradiance that was substantially lower during the Maunder minimum than the one observed today. The difference is remarkably larger than other estimations published in the recent literature. The magnitude of the solar UV variability, which indirectly affects the climate, is also found to exceed previous estimates.We discuss in detail the assumptions that lead us to this conclusion.},

abstract = {CO2 and heat fluxes were measured over a six-week period (09/08/2006 to 10/24/2006) by the eddy covariance (EC) technique at the Horseshoe Lake tree kill (HLTK), Mammoth Mountain, CA, a site with complex terrain and high, spatially heterogeneous CO2 emission rates. EC CO2 fluxes ranged from 218 to 3500 g m- 2 d- 1 (mean = 1346 g m- 2 d- 1). Using footprint modeling, EC CO2 fluxes were compared to CO2 fluxes measured by the chamber method on a grid repeatedly over a 10-day period. Half-hour EC CO2 fluxes were moderately correlated (R2 = 0.42) with chamber fluxes, whereas average daily EC CO2 fluxes were well correlated (R2 = 0.70) with chamber measurements. Average daily EC CO2 fluxes were correlated with both average daily wind speed and atmospheric pressure; relationships were similar to those observed between chamber CO2 fluxes and the atmospheric parameters over a comparable time period. Energy balance closure was assessed by statistical regression of EC energy fluxes (sensible and latent heat) against available energy (net radiation, less soil heat flux). While incomplete (R2 = 0.77 for 1:1 line), the degree of energy balance closure fell within the range observed in many investigations conducted in contrasting ecosystems and climates. Results indicate that despite complexities presented by the HLTK, EC can be reliably used to monitor background variations in volcanic CO2 fluxes associated with meteorological forcing, and presumably changes related to deeply derived processes such as volcanic activity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We report the results of eight soil CO2 efflux surveys by the closed circulation chamber method at the Horseshoe Lake tree kill (HLTK) - the largest tree kill on Mammoth Mountain. The surveys were undertaken from 1995 to 1999 to constrain total HLTK CO2 emissions and to evaluate occasional efflux surveys as a surveillance tool for the tree kills. HLTK effluxes range from 1 to {\textgreater} 10,000 g m -2 day -1 (grams CO2 per square meter per day); they are not normally distributed. Station efflux rates can vary by 7-35{\%} during the course of the 8- to 16-h surveys. Disturbance of the upper 2 cm of ground surface causes effluxes to almost double. Semivariograms of efflux spatial covariance fit exponential or spherical models; they lack nugget effects. Efflux contour maps and total CO2 emission rates based on exponential, spherical, and linear kriging models of survey data are nearly identical; similar results are also obtained with triangulation models, suggesting that the kriging models are not seriously distorted by the lack of normal efflux distributions. In addition, model estimates of total CO2 emission rates are relatively insensitive to the measurement precision of the efflux rates and to the efflux value used to separate magmatic from forest soil sources of CO2. Surveys since 1997 indicate that, contrary to earlier speculations, a termination of elevated CO2 emissions at the HLTK is unlikely anytime soon. The HLTK CO2 efflux anomaly fluctuated greatly in size and intensity throughout the 1995-1999 surveys but maintained a N-S elongation, presumably reflecting fault control of CO2 transport from depth. Total CO2 emission rates also fluctuated greatly, ranging from 46 to 136 t day-1 (metric tons CO2 per day) and averaging 93 t day-1. The large inter-survey variations are caused primarily by external (meteorological) processes operating on time scales of hours to days. The externally caused variations can mask significant changes occurring at depth; a striking example is the masking of a degassing event generated at depth and detected by a soil gas sensor network in September 1997 while an efflux survey was in progress. Thus, occasional efflux surveys are not an altogether effective surveillance tool for the HLTK, and making them effective by greatly increasing their frequency may not be practical.

However, the quality of soil resources as defined by their potential impact on human health by propagation of harmful elements through the food chain has been poorly studied in Europe due to the lack of data of adequate detail and reliability. The European Union's first harmonized topsoil sampling and coherent analytical procedure produced trace element measurements from approximately 22,000 locations. This unique collection of information enables a reliable overview of the concentration of heavy metals, also referred to as metal(loid)s including As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn, Sb. Co, and Ni. In this article we propose that in some cases (e.g. Hg and Cd) the high concentrations of soil heavy metal attributed to human activity can be detected at a regional level. While the immense majority of European agricultural land can be considered adequately safe for food production, an estimated 6.24{\%} or 137,000 km2needs local assessment and eventual remediation action.},

abstract = {Diffuse degassing at Galeras volcano, Colombia, was studied during three consecutive field seasons from 1993 to 1995. Measurements of222Rn and CO2 were made at 30 stations which were distributed on the volcano and on regional faults intersecting the edifice. Time series data show a decline of radon soil gas of up to 50{\%} prior to a M 2.8 earthquake on 12 August 1993 at stations located near the epicenter and on the volcano near the location of earthquake swarms which occurred in April 1993, November-December 1993 and March 1995. The onset of volcanic seismic activity ([`]tornillos') on 9 August 1994 was preceded by anomalous soil gas increases at six stations located on the flanks of the volcano. On the southwestern flank, radon increased from 51 to 130 pCi/1 between 7 and 14 August, while on the northern flank, radon concentrations began to increase 19 days before the appearance of tornillos. In general, stations close to the crater showed the largest radon increases. Soil gas distributions and carbon isotope data suggest that diffuse degassing on the volcano is structurally controlled and that the abundance of CO2 in soil gas on the edifice cannot be taken as an indicator for the presence of magmatic gases. Radon soil gas concentrations and the222Rn emanating226Ra concentration increase near faults, whereas CO2 concentrations are more variable but commonly are higher on the volcano than near faults. [delta]13C values in soil CO2 vary between -8.5 and -23.2[per mille sign], with [delta]13C values more enriched than -15[per mille sign] found only in the vicinity of faults or sites prone to earthquake swarms. This suggests a magmatic origin of CO2 soil gas only near faults and an almost impermeable edifice in unfractured areas. The observed correlations between seismic activity and soil degassing provide further evidence that soil gas studies, especially when correlated to other methods of volcano surveillance such as seismicity and deformation, may be useful in forecasting volcanic and seismic events.},

abstract = {The experience from CO2 injection at pilot projects (Frio, Ketzin, Nagaoka, US Regional Partnerships) and existing commercial operations (Sleipner, Sn??hvit, In Salah, acid-gas injection) demonstrates that CO2 geological storage in saline aquifers is technologically feasible. Monitoring and verification technologies have been tested and demonstrated to detect and track the CO2 plume in different subsurface geological environments. By the end of 2008, approximately 20 Mt of CO2 had been successfully injected into saline aquifers by existing operations. Currently, the highest injection rate and total storage volume for a single storage operation are approximately 1 Mt CO2/year and 25 Mt, respectively. If carbon capture and storage (CCS) is to be an effective option for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, commercial-scale storage operations will require orders of magnitude larger storage capacity than accessed by the existing sites. As a result, new demonstration projects will need to develop and test injection strategies that consider multiple injection wells and the optimisation of the usage of storage space. To accelerate large-scale CCS deployment, demonstration projects should be selected that can be readily employed for commercial use; i.e. projects that fully integrate the capture, transport and storage processes at an industrial emissions source. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

New geochemical, hydrological, and neo-tectonic data suggests that existing models that involve recharge in eastern Australia, relatively simple flowpaths and discharge in springs in the western margin require modification. New geochemical data indicate a small volume flux of deeply derived (endogenic) fluids mixing into the aquifer system at a continental scale.

abstract = {Issue Title: Energy Storage and Release through the Solar Activity Cycle - Models Meet Radio Observations | Guest Editors: Christophe Marqu{\'{e}} and Alexander Nindos On 17 January 2005 two fast coronal mass ejections were recorded in close succession during two distinct episodes of a 3B/X3.8 flare. Both were accompanied by metre-to-kilometre type-III groups tracing energetic electrons that escape into the interplanetary space and by decametre-to-hectometre type-II bursts attributed to CME-driven shock waves. A peculiar type-III burst group was observed below 600 kHz 1.5 hours after the second type-III group. It occurred without any simultaneous activity at higher frequencies, around the time when the two CMEs were expected to interact. We associate this emission with the interaction of the CMEs at heliocentric distances of about 25 R {\^{}}sub {\^{}}. Near-relativistic electrons observed by the EPAM experiment onboard ACE near 1 AU revealed successive particle releases that can be associated with the two flare/CME events and the low-frequency type-III burst at the time of CME interaction. We compare the pros and cons of shock acceleration and acceleration in the course of magnetic reconnection for the escaping electron beams revealed by the type-III bursts and for the electrons measured in situ.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {We report chemical compositions (major and trace components including light hydrocarbons), hydrogen, oxygen, helium and nitrogen isotope ratios of volcanic and geothermal fluids of Mutnovsky volcano, Kamchatka. Several aspects of the geochemistry of fluids are discussed: chemical equilibria, mixing of fluids from different sources, evaluation of the parent magmatic gas composition and contributions to magmatic vapors of fluids from different reservoirs of the Kamchatkan subduction zone. Among reactive species, hydrogen and carbon monoxide in volcanic vapors are chemically equilibrated at temperatures {\textgreater}300C with the SO2-H2S redox-pair. A metastable equilibrium between saturated and unsaturated light hydrocarbons is attained at close to discharge temperatures. Methane is disequilibrated. Three different sources of fluids from three fumarolic fields in the Mutnovsky craters can be distinguished: (1) magmatic gas from a large convecting magma body discharging through Active Funnel, a young crater with the hottest fumaroles (up to 620C) contributing {\~{}}80{\%} to the total volcanic gas output; (2) volcanic fluid from a separate shallow magma body beneath the Bottom Field of the main crater (96280C fumaroles); and (3) hydrothermal fluid with a high relative and absolute concentrations of CH4 from the Upper Field in the main crater (96285C fumaroles). The composition of the parent magmatic gas is estimated using water isotopes and correlations between He and other components in the Active Funnel gases. The He-Ar-N2 systematics of volcanic and hydrothermal fluids of Mutnovsky are consistent with a large slab-derived sedimentary nitrogen input for the nitrogen inventory, and we calculate that only {\~{}}1{\%} of the magmatic N2 has a mantle origin and {\textless}{\textless}1{\%} is derived from the arc crust.},

abstract = {In this paper the very first geochemical and isotopic data related to surface and spring waters and dissolved gases in the area of Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces (Burgos, Spain) are presented and discussed. Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces has been selected as a pilot site for the injection of pure ({\textgreater}99{\%}) CO2. Injection and monitoring wells are planned to be drilled close to 6 oil wells completed in the 1980s for which detailed stratigraphical logs are available, indicating the presence of a confined saline aquifer at the depth of about 1500m into which less than 100,000 tons of liquid CO2 will be injected, possibly starting in 2013.The chemical and features of the spring waters suggest that they are related to a shallow hydrogeological system as the concentration of the Total Dissolved Solids approaches 800mg/L with a Ca2+(Mg2+)-HCO3$\backslash$n- composition, similar to that of the surface waters. This is also supported by the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios that have values lying between those of the Global and the Mediterranean Meteoric Water Lines. Some spring waters close to the oil wells are characterized by relatively high concentrations of NO3$\backslash$n- (up to 123mg/L), unequivocally suggesting an anthropogenic source that adds to the main water-rock interaction processes. The latter can be referred to Ca-Mg-carbonate and, at a minor extent, Al-silicate dissolution, being the outcropping sedimentary rocks characterized by Palaeozoic to Quaternary rocks. Anomalous concentrations of Cl-, SO4$\backslash$n2-, As, B and Ba were measured in two springs discharging a few hundred meters from the oil wells and in the Rio Ubierna. These contents are significantly higher than those of the whole set of the studied waters and are possibly indicative of mixing processes, although at very low extent, between deep and shallow aquifers. No evidence of deep-seated gases interacting with the Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces waters was recognized in the chemistry of the dissolved gases. This is likely due to the fact that they are mainly characterized by an atmospheric source as highlighted by the high contents of N2, O2 and Ar and by N2/Ar ratios that approach that of ASW (Air Saturated Water) and possibly masking any contribution related to a deep source. Nevertheless, significant concentrations (up to 63{\%} by vol.) of isotopically negative CO2 ({\textless}-17.7‰ V-PDB) were found in some water samples, likely related to a biogenic source.The geochemical and isotopic data of this work are of particular importance when a monitoring program will be established to verify whether CO2 leakages, induced by the injection of this greenhouse gas, may be affecting the quality of the waters in the shallow hydrological circuits at Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces. In this respect, carbonate chemistry, the isotopic carbon of dissolved CO2 and TDIC (Total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon) and selected trace elements can be considered as useful parameters to trace the migration of the injected CO2 into near-surface environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Due to differences in smoking by gender, the PAF of radon-induced lung cancer deaths was higher in females. In the Republic of Korea, the risk of radon is not widely recognized. Thus, information about radon health risks is important and efforts are needed to decrease the associated health problems.},

abstract = {The majority of the definitions of estuaries have been based on the characteristics of estuaries in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. As previously pointed out (Day, 1980), such definitions do not take into account such features as periodic closure of their mouths and hypersaline conditions during dry periods, which characterise many estuaries in southern Africa and south-western Australia. There is also ambiguity as to whether an estuary sensu stricto must be fed by a river. The following definition was developed to encompass the main characteristics of all estuaries: An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water that is either permanently or periodically open to the sea and which receives at least periodic discharge from a river(s), and thus, while its salinity is typically less than that of natural sea water and varies temporally and along its length, it can become hypersaline in regions when evaporative water loss is high and freshwater and tidal inputs are negligible. Estuaries are thus regarded as unique ecosystems, which, in the case of fishes, for example, are occupied by species that collectively represent a particular suite of guilds. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Building on Charles Tilly's theory of categorical inequality, this article examines how the proliferation of visa categories created to accommodate labour shortages in South Korea has led to the development of noncitizen hierarchies. Although contemporary immigration policies in liberal democracies do not explicitly exclude particular categories of people based on race and gender, they continue to apply discriminatory measures that reinforce social inequalities. In countries where noncitizens range from migrant labourers to native-born foreign residents, visa categories are critical determinants of a migrant's residency status, eligibility for state-sponsored rights, geographic mobility, and prospects for citizenship acquisition. This article analyzes three levels of interaction between de facto and de jure categorical differentiation: (1) the extension of racial, gendered, and class-based meaning to specific visa categories (or, how the de facto informs the de jure); (2) the institutionalisation of categorical inequality (or, how the de jure hardens the de facto); and (3) the structural effects (or, how the de facto and de jure shape patterns of incorporation). By examining the process by which seemingly race and gender-neutral categories and policies assume meaning and convey power, we are better equipped to explore emergent forms of citizenship and non-citizenship, racial politics, and social hierarchies.},

abstract = {For decades we have learned about the physical hazards associated with plastic debris in the marine environment, but recently we are beginning to realize the chemical hazards. Assessing hazards associated with plastic in aquatic habitats is not simple, and requires knowledge regarding organisms that may be exposed, the exposure concentrations, the types of polymers comprising the debris, the length of time the debris was present in the aquatic environment (affecting the size, shape and fouling) and the locations and transport of the debris during that time period. Marine plastic debris is associated with a ‘cocktail of chemicals, including chemicals added or produced during manufacturing and those present in the marine environment that accumulate onto the debris from surrounding seawater. This raises concerns regarding: (i) the complex mixture of chemical substances associated with marine plastic debris, (ii) the environmental fate of these chemicals to and from plastics in our oceans and (iii) how this mixture affects wildlife, as hundreds of species ingest this material in nature. The focus of this chapter is on the mixture of chemicals associated with marine plastic debris. Specifically, this chapter discusses the diversity of chemical ingredients, byproducts of manufacturing and sorbed chemical contaminants from the marine environment among plastic types, the role of marine plastic debris as a novel medium for environmental partitioning of chemical contaminants in the ocean and the toxic effects that may result from plastic debris in marine animals.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal variability of the soil gas radon concentration in typical soils is studied. The results obtained will be further used to predict indoor radon levels. To this end, 50 measuring points along geologic sections with known physicogeological parameters of soils were chosen. The soil gas radon concentration was measured with SSNTDs (Type III-b) at a depth of 70 cm from June to October, 2000. The radon exposure time was 72-96 h. The average radon concentration in the soil pore air for an urban area was 11 kBq m -3 (1.7-24 kBq m-3). Small-scale spatial variations in the concentration were found to lie within a narrower range. The effect of meteorological conditions on the soil gas radon concentration was investigated by performing 8 series of measurements at 5 closely spaced points in September-October, 2000. A significant correlation was found between the soil radon concentration and atmospheric pressure (K = -0.86), ambient temperature (K = 0.75), and soil temperature (K = 0.75). {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Discharge of hydrothermal fluids at La Solfatara is one of the many pieces of evidence testifying to the level of activity and the potential danger characterizing the volcanic complex of the Phlegrean Fields. Recent measurements of diffuse degassing shed light on the unexpected magnitude of this process and prompted further research to improve our understanding of the hydrothermal system feeding the surface phenomenon at La Solfatara. In this work, we first present new data on CO2 diffuse degassing, that were collected during a campaign in July 2000, and confirm previous measurements of the degassing rate. These data, together with other information on subsurface structures and conditions, provided the necessary constraints to perform physical modelling of the hydrothermal fluid circulation at La Solfatara. Numerical simulations describe the ascent and evolution of a hot, multi-phase and multi-component fluid, composed of water and carbon dioxide, through a homogeneous, porous medium. When certain system properties and conditions are used this model reproduces some of the main features which characterize the natural system, including the energy budget associated with the ascent and condensation of hot fluids, and the development of a single-phase gas region whose existence was inferred from independent chemical data. Further simulations investigated the effects associated with changes in rock properties and fluid injection rates. Results showed that an increase in the permeability at shallow depth may have an important influence on the system conditions and fluid discharge. They imply that surface phenomena, accompanied by very high temperatures at shallow depths may survive long after deep feeding has ceased. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {GOAL, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: [corrected] Historically, landfills have been the simplest form of eliminating urban solid waste with the minimum cost. They have been the most usual method for discarding solid waste. However, landfills are considered authentic biochemical reactors that introduce large amounts of contaminants into the environment in the form of gas and leachates. The dynamics of generation and the movement of gas in landfills depend on the input and output parameters, as well as on the structure of the landfill and the kind of waste. The input parameters include water introduced through natural or artificial processes, the characteristics of the urban solid waste, and the input of atmospheric air. The main output parameters for these biochemical reactors include the gases and the leachates that are potentially pollutants for the environment. Control systems are designed and installed to minimize the impact on the environment. However, these systems are not perfect and a significant amount of landfill gas could be released to the atmosphere through the surface in a diffuse form, also known as Non-controlled emission. In this paper, the results of the Non-controlled biogenic gas emissions from the Lazareto landfill in Tenerife, Canary Islands, are presented. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the concentration of CH4 and CO2 in the soil gas of the landfill cover, the CH4 and CO2 efflux from the surface of the landfill and, finally, to compare these parameters with other similar landfills. In this way, a better understanding of the process that controls biogenic gas emissions in landfills is expected. METHODS: A Non-controlled biogenic gas emission survey of 281 sampling sites was carried out during February and March, 2002. The sampling sites were selected in order to obtain a well-distributed sampling grid. Surface landfill CO2 efflux measurements were carried out at each sampling site on the surface landfill together with soil gas collection and ground temperatures at a depth of 30-40 cm. The CH4 efflux was computed from CO2 efflux and from the ratio CH4/CO2 in the soil gas. Soil gas samples were collected at a depth of 30-40 cm using a metallic probe and 20 cc hypodermic syringes, and later stored in evacuated 10 cc vacutainers for laboratory analysis of bulk composition. The gas sample was introduced in a vacutainer filled with deionized water and displacing the water until the vacutainer was filled with the gas sample in order to avoid air contamination from entering. The surface landfill temperature of the landfill was measured at a depth of 40 cm using a digital thermometer type OMEGA 871A. Landfill gases, CO2 and CH4, were analyzed within 24 hours using a double channel VARIAN micro-GC QUAD CP-2002P, with a 10 meter PORAPLOT-Q column, a TCD detector, and He as a carrier gas. The analysis temperature was 40 degrees C and the injection time was 10 msec. Surface landfill CO2 efflux measurements were performed using a portable NDIR spectrophotometer Licor-800 according to the accumulation chamber method (Chiodini et al. 1996). The data treatment, aimed at drawing the flux map and computing the total gas output, was based on the application of stochastic simulation algorithms provided by the GSLIB program (Deutsch and Journel 1998). RESULTS: Diffuse CH4 and CO2 efflux values range from negligible values up to 7,148 and 30,573 g m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The spatial distribution of the concentration and efflux of CO2, CH4 and soil temperature, show three areas of maximum activity in the landfill, suggesting a non-uniform pattern of diffuse degassing. This correlation between high emissions and concentration of CO2, CH4 and soil temperatures suggests that the areas of higher microbial activity and exothermic reactions are releasing CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere from the landfill. Taking into consideration the spatial distribution of the CO2 and CH4 efflux values as well as the extension of the landfill, the Non-controlled emission of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere by the Lazareto's landfill are of 167 +/- 13.3 and 16 +/- 2.5 t d(-1), respectively. DISCUSSION: The patterns of gas flow within the landfill seem to be affected by boundary materials at the sides. The basalt layers have a low permeability and the gas flow in these areas is extensive. In this area, where a basalt layer does not exist, the flow gas diffuses toward the sea and the flux emissions at the landfill surface are lower. This behavior reflects the possible dissolution of gases into water and the deflection of gases towards the surface at the basalt boundary. The proximity to the sea, the installation of a palm tree garden and, as a result, the contribution of water coming from the watering of this garden has reactivated the system. The introduction of sea water into the landfill and the type of boundary could be defining the superficial gas discharges. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study indicate that the spatial distribution of Non-controlled emission of CO2 and CH4 at the Lazareto's landfill shows a non-uniform pattern of diffuse degassing. The northeast, central and northwest areas of the Lazareto's landfill are the three areas of high emissions and concentration of CO2 and CH4, and high temperatures. The correlation between high emissions and the concentration of CO2, CH4, and the high temperatures suggest that the areas of higher microbial activity and exothermic reactions are releasing more CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere from the landfill. A high concentration of CO2 is probably due to the presence of methanotrophic bacteria in the soil atmosphere of the landfill. Patterns of gas flow within the landfill seem to be affected by boundary materials (basalt layers) of low permeability, and side boundaries of the flux emissions at the surface are higher. At the sides of seawater and sediment boundaries, flux emissions at the landfill surface are lower. This behavior reflects a possible dissolution of gases into the water and the deflection of gases towards the surface at the basalt boundary. With this study, we can compare the data obtained in this landfill with other landfills and observe the different levels of emission. The proximity to the sea and the installation of the palm tree garden palms and, as a result, the contribution of water coming from the watering of this garden has reactivated the system. Many landfills worldwide located in similar settings could experience similar gas production processes. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The need for investigating and monitoring sea water and sediment quality in these landfills is advisable. Concentrations and fluxes of contaminants and their impact in the area should be assessed. With this study we can compare the data obtained in these landfills with other landfills and observe the different levels of emission.},

Recently, more research has focused on the effects of armed conflict on land systems, but still little is known about the processes and outcomes of such events. Here we use the case of Syria and Iraq and the seizure of land by the Islamic State (IS) since 2014 as an example of armed conflict, where we investigate the effects on agricultural land use. We apply a reproducible approach using 250 m satellite-based time-series data to quantify the areas under cultivation from 2000 to 2015. Despite a common belief about widespread land abandonment in areas under conflict, results point to multiple trajectories regarding cropland cultivation in the IS seized area: (1) expansion of cropland to formerly un-cultivated areas, (2) cropland abandonment, and (3) decrease of high-intensity cropland. Our study highlights the need to understand these diverse conflict-related and context-dependent changes to the land system.},

The number of cancer patients aged {\textgreater}70 years is significantly increased among the cancer patient population. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical importance of age in lung cancer. Data from 110 patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer, who were treated and followed up in the Institute of Oncology, University of Istanbul, were recorded from medical charts. There were 100 (91{\%}) males with a median age of 59 years (range, 35-88 years). The majority of patients had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 84{\%}) and metastatic stage (56{\%}). The rate of positive response to chemotherapy was lower in elderly patients (P=0.01) and the incidence of anemia was higher compared with that in younger patients (P=0.02). The majority of mortalities occurred in elderly patients (P=0.01). The median survival time of elderly patients was significantly lower compared with that of younger patients (37.8 vs. 57 weeks; P=0.009). The 1-year survival rates in younger and elderly patients were 67.3 and 42.5{\%}, respectively. In multivariate analysis, elderly patients also had significantly poorer survival (P=0.023). In the group of elderly patients, analyses revealed that significant prognostic factors, including stage of disease and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, were associated with survival. Elderly patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer had a poorer outcome compared with those with NSCLC (P=0.009), and older patients with elevated serum LDH levels had a shorter survival time compared with those with normal levels (P=0.042). In conclusion, age is one of the major prognostic factors affecting survival in lung cancer patients; therefore, patients should be managed according to age in clinical practice.},

abstract = {From the end of 1996 through March 1999, the spatial and temporal variability of the soil 222Rn concentration was investigated at a 20 m×20 m test field with porous soil in 0.5 m and 1.0 m depth at nine positions each and at 1×1 m plots at four positions each. For this, soil gas was collected weekly into evacuated scintillation cells and was analysed subsequently for radon activity. In the 20 m×20 m field the spatial variability was characterized by coefficients of variation (C.V.) of 26{\%} at 0.5 m, and 13{\%} at 1.0 m depth. Within the 1 m×1 m plots the C.V. values were 4{\%} and 2{\%}, i.e. within the uncertainty of the method. Time series analysis (TSA) of the soil radon data shows seasonal variations with maximum concentrations in the winter months. Radon concentrations ranged from 6 to 50 kBq m-3 in 0.5 m depth, and from 8 to 34 kBq m-3 in 1.0 m depth. Mostly, the concentrations were higher in 0.5 depth than in 1.0 m depth. However, seasonal variation of the 0.5 m to the 1.0 m concentration ratio has been verified by TSA. To test the variability resulting from different methods, additional procedures and instruments were investigated at the 20 m×20 m field and at a second test field with a different soil type. Soil gas sampling into evacuated scintillation cells was selected as the reference procedure. Soil radon concentrations obtained with the different sampling procedures and detection methods at the 20 m×20 m field essentially agreed within the limits of uncertainty of the methods tested. At the second test field, i.e. in a largely impermeable soil, deviations up to a factor of two related to the reference procedure were observed.

abstract = {Measurements of CH4 and CO2 concentrations in soil gas, and as exchange rates (fluxes) with the atmosphere were made over the Rangely oil field, Colorado, USA. The Rangely field has been operated as a large CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project since 1986, and may serve as a prototype for CO2 sequestration in depleted oil/gas fields. The first of this pair of papers reported on the details of the methodology and results of field measurements of these gases, including light alkanes. The interpretation was enhanced by the extensive use of 13C and some 14C measurements. The fluxes of both CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere were estimated. This research has demonstrated and quantified the methanotrophic oxidation of microseeping CH4 in the unsaturated zone. Strong spatial variations were found and studied further by nested soil gas sampling in holes up to 9 m deep. Areas of microseepage were found, as well as areas where atmospheric CH4 was the only source for methanotrophic oxidation. Computer modeling was used to determine rate constants for the oxidation process. Strong seasonal differences exist in the rates of CH4 oxidation because of the semiarid and severe climate of Rangely. Rate constants of {\textless} 1 to {\textgreater} 1000 day-1 were determined. During the summer, the highest rates were near the surface, but shifted downward to about 2 m depth in the winter. Methanotrophic oxidation of CH 4 in the unsaturated zone will be the most important component of amelioration of CH4 microseepage induced by overpressuring of the reservoir undergoing CO2 injection. These types of measurements and interpretation will be necessary in order to fully understand the environmental effects of CO2 sequestration in oil/gas fields. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {It is well known that one of the factors that influence the indoor radon variability is the floor level of the buildings. Considering the fact that the main source of indoor radon is radon in soil gas, it is expected that the radon concentration decreases at higher floors. Thus at higher floors the dominant source of radon is originating from building materials, and in some cases there may be deviations from the generally established regularity. In such sense, we chose one freestanding single-family house with loft and other 16-floor high-rise residential building for this study. The indoor radon measurements were performed by two methods: passive and active. We used passive devices based on track-etched detectors: Radtrak2 Radonova. For the short-term indoor radon measurements, we used two active devices: SN1029 and SN1030 (manufactured by Sun Nuclear Corporation). The first device was fixed in the living room at the ground level and the second was moved through the floors of the residential building. Every measuring cycle at the specified floor lasted seven days with the sampling time of 2 h. The results show two different indoor radon behaviours regarding radon variability due to floor level. In the single-family house with loft we registered intense difference between radon concentration in the ground level and loft, while in the high-rise residential building the radon level was almost the same at all floors, and hence we may conclude that radon originated mainly from building materials.},

From August 3 to 10, 2007, 0.3 tons CO2/day were released through a 70 m horizontal pipe located at a nominal depth of 1.8 m below the surface. Hyperspectral images of alfalfa plants were collected during the controlled release and used along with classification tree analysis to study changes in the reflectance spectra as a function of perpendicular distance from the horizontal pipe. Changes in the reflectance spectra near the red edge (650-750 nm) were observed over the course of the controlled release experiment for plants within a perpendicular distance of 1 m of the release pipe. These results indicate monitoring vegetation over a carbon sequestration site has the potential to allow monitoring of the integrity of the CO2 storage. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Information extracted from water retention properties are commonly used to evaluate soil structure. The objective of this work was to derive and test a soil entropy measure of pore size distributions (SH) from the parameters of a water retention model that assumes a log-normal distribution of soil pores. The SH function uses information on saturated and residual water contents and geometric mean pore size and geometric standard deviation. The SH function was tested with water retention data taken from separate published studies on soil textural class averages, soil compaction, and structural development in the rhizosphere. Values of SH ranged from -0.07 to about 4. Lower values were found in textural classes dominated by clay and in compacted soils; SH values were between 48{\%} and 100{\%} greater in soil aggregates from the rhizosphere of three crops than in aggregates sampled away from the roots. Compaction decreased the values of entropy by decreasing the values of geometric mean and/or standard deviation characterizing a pore size distribution. Soil entropy SH was correlated to saturated hydraulic conductivity from compaction studies (P {\textless} 0.001). Similar trend was followed by K s and SH estimated from textural averages. The proposed SH function is a potentially useful measure of soil structure that is not restricted to a particular mathematical model of soil-water retention. Further improvement of SH should distinguish between porosity related to texture from porosity associated to soil structure. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 by Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

It can be employed in the range of 3??10-13-8.0??10-11m2, extending the upper detection limit of RADON JOK (1.8??10-11). Its use is recommended to investigate radon and other gas transfer through the soil and to map radon or CO2 potentials of a given site.

For example, the highest two levels of radon in the solar homes give doses over 30 years that are known to produce lung cancer in 1{\%} of uranium miners. Summer readings in more than one-half of the cases are different from winter ones by a factor of two or more, so that year-round measurements are necessary for precise dosimetry.

abstract = {Many plant traits covary in a non-random manner reflecting interdependencies associated with "ecological strategy" dimensions. To understand how plants integrate their structural and physiological investments, data on leaf and leaflet size and the ratio of leaf area to sapwood area ($\Phi$LS) obtained for 1020 individual trees (encompassing 661 species) located in 52 tropical forest plots across the Amazon Basin were incorporated into an analysis utilising existing data on species maximum height (Hmax), seed size, leaf mass per unit area (MA), foliar nutrients and $\delta$13C, and branch xylem density ($\rho$x). Utilising a common principal components approach allowing eigenvalues to vary between two soil fertility dependent species groups, five taxonomically controlled trait dimensions were identified. The first involves primarily cations, foliar carbon and MA and is associated with differences in foliar construction costs. The second relates to some components of the classic "leaf economic spectrum", but with increased individual leaf areas and a higher $\Phi$LS newly identified components for tropical tree species. The third relates primarily to increasing Hmax and hence variations in light acquisition strategy involving greater MA, reductions in $\Phi$LS and less negative $\delta$13C. Although these first three dimensions were more important for species from high fertility sites the final two dimensions were more important for low fertility species and were associated with variations linked to reproductive and shade tolerance strategies. Environmental conditions influenced structural traits with $\rho$x of individual species decreasing with increased soil fertility and higher temperatures. This soil fertility response appears to be synchronised with increases in foliar nutrient concentrations and reductions in foliar [C]. Leaf and leaflet area and $\Phi$LS were less responsive to the environment than $\rho$x. Thus, although genetically determined foliar traits such as those associated with leaf construction costs coordinate independently of structural characteristics such as maximum height, others such as the classical "leaf economic spectrum" covary with structural traits such as leaf size and $\Phi$LS. Coordinated structural and physiological adaptions are also associated with light acquisition/shade tolerance strategies with several traits such as MA and [C] being significant components of more than one ecological strategy dimension. This is argued to be a consequence of a range of different potential underlying causes for any observed variation in such "ambiguous" traits. Environmental effects on structural and physiological characteristics are also coordinated but in a different way to the gamut of linkages associated with genotypic differences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

In the light of this, this study examines the application of seasonal correction factors to indoor radon concentrations in the UK. This practice is based on an extensive database gathered by the National Radiological Protection Board over the years (small-scale surveys began in 1976 and continued with a larger scale survey in 1988) and reflects well known seasonal variations observed in indoor radon levels. However, due to the complexity of underlying geology (the UK arguably has the world's most complex solid and surficial geology over the shortest distances) and considerable variations in permeability of underlying materials it is clear that there are a significant number of occurrences where the application of a seasonal correction factor may give rise to over-estimated or under-estimated radon levels. Therefore, the practice of applying a seasonal correction should be one that is undertaken with caution, or not at all.

abstract = {Geoscience Australia and the Australian State and Territory Geological Surveys have systematically surveyed most of the Australian continent over the past 40 years using airborne gamma- ray spectrometry to map potassium, uranium and thorium elemental concentrations at the Earth's surface. However, the individual surveys that comprise the national gamma- ray spectrometric radioelement database are not all registered to the same datum. This limits the usefulness of the database as it is not possible to easily combine surveys into regional compilations or make accurate comparisons between radiometric signatures in different survey areas. To solve these problems, Geoscience Australia has undertaken an AustraliaWide Airborne Geophysical Survey (AWAGS), funded under the Australian Government's Onshore Energy Security Program, to serve as a radioelement baseline for all current and future airborne gamma- ray spectrometric surveys in Australia. The AWAGS survey has been back-calibrated to the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) radioelement datum. Wehave used theAWAGSdata to level the national radioelement database by estimating survey correction factors that, once applied, minimise both the differences in radioelement estimates between surveys (where these surveys overlap) and the differences between the surveys and theAWAGStraverses. The database is thus effectively levelled to the IAEA datum. The levelled database has been used to produce the first 'Radiometric Map of Australia' - levelled and merged composite potassium ({\%} K), uranium (ppm eU) and thorium (ppm eTh) grids over Australia at 100m resolution. Interpreters can use the map to reliably compare the radiometric signatures observed over different parts of Australia. This enables the assessment of key mineralogical and geochemical properties of bedrock and regolith materials from different geological provinces and regions with contrasting landscape histories.},

Chronological data of sulphide mineralization and of a phreatomagmatic deposit close to Solforata fit with a temporal window (26-47 ka BP) of intense volcanic activity which occurred during the final hydromagmatic phase (180-11 ka BP) of the Alban Hills volcano. Radon measurements have allowed an estimation of fluxes of the main gases presently released at Solforata. A model combining Darcy's law and modified Stoker-Kruger equations has been used in order to predict the upper limit of the gas pressure (19 atmospheres) at the base of the volcanic succession and of the rising time (35 days) of the gas through the volcanic pile. Geochronological and geochemical constraints, obtained by U-series disequilibrium methods, have proved useful in comparing the volcanic and geochemical risks in this area. The comparison shows that, under normal conditions of gas dispersion, the geochemical risk associated with Rn and H2S exposure is high and it must be tackled immediately with particular surveillance and intervention methods.

We explore these issues within the context of a risk-based water supply management problem, where a city seeks the most efficient use of a water market. The case study examines a single city's water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas, using a suite of 6-objective problem formulations that have increasing decision complexity for both a 10-year planning horizon and an extreme single-year drought scenario. The de Novo planning framework demonstrated illustrates how to adaptively improve the value and robustness of our problem formulations by evolving our definition of optimality while discovering key tradeoffs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Beginning in the nineteen-eighties, a national radon survey consisting in more than 10,000 measurements of indoor radon concentrations was conducted in French dwellings by the Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN). Housing characteristics, which may influence radon accumulation in dwellings, were also collected. More recently, the IRSN generated a French geogenic radon potential map based on the interpretation of geological features. The present study analyzed the two datasets to investigate the factors influencing indoor radon concentrations using statistical modeling and to determine the optimum use of the information on geogenic radon potential that showed the best statistical association with indoor radon concentration. The results showed that the variables associated with indoor radon concentrations were geogenic radon potential, building material, year of construction, foundation type, building type and floor level. The model, which included the surrounding geogenic radon potential (i.e. the average geogenic radon potential within a disc of radius 20km centered on the indoor radon measurement point) and variables describing house-specific factors and lifestyle explained about 20{\%} of the overall variability of the logarithm of radon concentration. The surrounding geogenic radon potential was fairly closely associated with the local average indoor radon concentration. The prevalence of exposure to radon above specific thresholds and the average exposures to radon clearly increased with increasing classes of geogenic radon potential. Combining the two datasets enabled improved assessment of radon exposure in a given area in France. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Groundwater U is associated with incompatible elements (S, As, Mo, F, and Cs) in water samples within granitic intrusions. Elevated [U] and [Rn] are located within 5-10 km distance of granitic intrusions but do not show correlations with metamorphism at intermediate scales (10(0)-10(1) km). This spatial association is confirmed by a high-density sampling (n = 331, 5-40 samples per km(2)) at local scales (≤10(-1) km) and the statewide sampling (n = 5857, 1 sample per 16 km(2)) at regional scales (10(2)-10(3) km). Wells located within 5 km of granitic intrusions are at risk of containing high levels of [U] and [Rn].

abstract = {Numerous research results have been published on the storage science and the technology of CO2 storage in saline aquifers to address the knowledge gaps identified by the IPCC Special Report on Carbon Capture and Storage in 2005. Significant progress has been made towards developing consistent methodologies for the classification and determination of CO2 storage capacity and towards comprehensive guidelines regarding site selection, site characterisation, risk assessment and monitoring and plans. Although advancements have been made with respect to geochemical processes and numerical simulations, a larger portfolio of CO2 storage operations is needed to provide realistic data for model calibration and substantiation of time frames for various trapping mechanisms. The experience from existing storage projects has shown that CO2 geological storage in saline aquifers is a technology that can be successfully and safely applied today. However, proper regulations for CO2 storage are needed to reduce the current uncertainty associated with the economics of CO2 storage and to accelerate the deployment of CCS technology. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Maps of indoor radon levels are frequently generated by averaging measurements on an administrative basis and subsequently classifying radon levels according to various regulatory thresholds. Such classification of "risk areas" certainly facilitates decision-making as local average values are usually not put into question as long as the number of measurements made is considered sufficient. One would still be tempted to further apply geostatistical techniques for producing maps showing local probabilities to exceed a given threshold as the information obtained should be more useful for a cost effective remediation strategy. An apparent obstacle to the use of geostatistics here is the very high level of fluctuations found between measurements made in neighbouring dwellings. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the use of geostatistics for the mapping of indoor radon levels using a set of around 11 000 measurements made on the ground floors of Austrian dwellings. The further normalisation of the data using Friedmann's radon potential is further discussed.},

abstract = {Smallholder labor migration and its relationship to climate change adaptation has received increasing attention, with migration often represented either as part of successful adaptive livelihood diversification or as symptomatic of a lack of in-place adaptive capacity. Using a case study, we focus on the relationship between labor migration, agrarian livelihood diversification, and climate change to further a more nuanced understanding of “migration as adaptation” than is implied by a simple dichotomy of success versus failure. Smallholder diversification, both on- and off-farm, has largely been framed as a risk-spreading practice that lowers climate change vulnerability. But after decades of advocating livelihood diversification, with labor migration now increasingly a part of smallholder livelihood activities, it is urgent to pose a number of questions: Why do smallholders migrate? How does labor migration unfold for them and with what outcomes? Our primary goal here is to explore the nature of the relationship of labor migration to climate change and climate change adaptation. Through empirical fieldwork in northwestern Nicaragua, we explore the role of labor migration in smallholder household production and reproduction, as families confront increasingly difficult climatic conditions for agricultural production and a relative absence of the state within a neoliberal political economy. Our analysis draws on household surveys and qualitative interviews and focus groups we carried out in the municipality of Somotillo, in northwestern Nicaragua, over three years (2013–15). Our findings demonstrate that household labor migration neither facilitates adaptation to climate change nor reflects a failure to adapt, but rather reflects the weak position of smallholders in interlocking relations of power and the relative land scarcity experienced by many. We argue that labor migration barely maintains semi-subsistence agricultural production and reinforces existing social inequalities, raising questions regarding a conceptualization of “migration as adaptation” and the benefits of this type of livelihood diversification.},

abstract = {The Pechelbronn oilfield (Rhine Graben, France), where mining activity ended in the 1960s, has been used for waste disposal for twenty years. Since the wastes are varied, work is underway to identify the discharged materials and their derivatives, as well as to locate and quantify potential discharge sites. Two major goals were assigned to the present work. The first was to identify or refine the location of hidden structures that could facilitate gas emanation up to the surface, by studying soil gas concentrations (mainly 222Rn, CO2, CH4 and helium) and carbon isotope ratios in the CO2 phase. The second was devoted to examining, from a health and safety viewpoint, if the use of the oilfield as a waste disposal site might have led to enhanced or modified gas emanation throughout the area.It appeared that CO2 and 222Rn evolution in the whole area were similar, except near some of the faults and fractures that are known through surface mapping and underground observations. These 222Rn and CO2 anomalies made it possible to highlight more emissive zones that are either related to main faults or to secondary fractures acting as migration pathways. In that sense, the CO2 phase can be used to evaluate 222Rn activities distant from tectonic structures but can lead to erroneous evaluations near to gas migration pathways. Dumping of wastes, as well as oil residues, did not appear to have a strong influence on soil gaseous species and emanation. Similarly, enhanced gas migration due to underground galleries and exploitation wells has not been established. Carbon isotope ratios suggested a balance of biological phenomena, despite the high CO2 contents reached. Other monitored gaseous species (N2, Ar, H2 and alkanes), when detected, always showed amounts close to those found subsurface and/or in atmospheric gases. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The rapid development of China's economy is increasingly dependent on these two subsystems. Analyses of the relationship between urbanization and water use or energy consumption have become the focus of attention, but researchers have mainly evaluated the impact on the two subsystems separately without providing an integrated analysis, nor have they revealed the link between water use and energy consumption. We addressed this information gap by using an econometric method to empirically investigate the long-term equilibrium relationships and Granger causal relationships among urbanization, water use, and energy consumption in China, and by conducting a spatiotemporal analysis to identify the trends of water use intensity and energy consumption intensity under the effects of urbanization during 2005-2015. We found long-term equilibrium relationships among urbanization, water use, and energy consumption. Granger causality results reveal the presence of a unidirectional Granger causal relationship running from urbanization to energy consumption and to water use, and bidirectional causality between energy consumption and water use. Moreover, water use intensity and energy consumption intensity decreased significantly under urbanization during the study period.},

abstract = {Two Italian areas, characterized by different seismological histories, were investigated to enhance the basic knowledge of gas migration mechanisms during earthquakes. Sharp variations occur in the movement and concentration of some gaseous species due to the evolution of the local stress regime. The first area (Colpasquale) is located in the central Italian region of Marche and provided a good location to study gas migration in a seismically active region. The area was devastated by a sequence of shallow earthquakes over a 3. month-long period (September-December, 1997). The occurrence of this catastrophic event, as well as the long duration of the " seismic sequence" , presented a unique opportunity to study gas migration in a zone undergoing active displacement. Soil gas surveys were performed 1 day, 1 week, 1 year and 2 years after the main shock (Ms 5.6) in the Colpasquale area. In particular, results highlight a change in the Rn distribution during the three monitoring years indicating a variation of gas migration that may be linked to the evolution of the stress regime.The second study area is located in the Campidano Graben (southern part of Sardinia Island). This area is characterized by seismic quiescence, displaying an almost complete lack of historical earthquakes and instrumentally recorded seismicity. The consistently low values observed for all analyzed gases suggest that the studied area is likely characterized by sealed, non-active faults that prevent significant gas migration. The comparison of data from both studied areas indicate that soil gas geochemistry is useful to locate tectonic discontinuities even when they intersect non-cohesive clastic rocks near the surface and thus are not visible (i.e., " blind faults" ). ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The data sets used are (i) estimated ²²⁶Ra in the {\textless} 2 mm fraction of topsoils (eRa226) derived from equivalent uranium (eU) from airborne gamma spectrometry data, (ii) eRa226 derived from measurements of uranium in soil geochemical samples, (iii) soil gas radon and (iv) indoor radon data. For models comparing indoor radon and (i) eRa226 derived from airborne eU data and (ii) soil gas radon data, some of the geological groupings have significant slopes. For these groupings there is reasonable agreement in slope and intercept between the three regression analysis methods (LS, TS and WTLS). Relationships between radon in dwellings and radium in the ground or radon in soil differ depending on the characteristics of the underlying geological units, with more permeable units having steeper slopes and higher indoor radon concentrations for a given radium or soil gas radon concentration in the ground. The regression models comparing indoor radon with soil gas radon have intercepts close to 5 Bq m⁻³ whilst the intercepts for those comparing indoor radon with eRa226 from airborne eU vary from about 20 Bq m⁻³ for a moderately permeable geological unit to about 40 Bq m⁻³ for highly permeable limestone, implying unrealistically high contributions to indoor radon from sources other than the ground. An intercept value of 5 Bq m⁻³ is assumed as an appropriate mean value for the UK for sources of indoor radon other than radon from the ground, based on examination of UK data. Comparison with published data used to derive an average indoor radon: soil ²²⁶Ra ratio shows that whereas the published data are generally clustered with no obvious correlation, the data from this study have substantially different relationships depending largely on the permeability of the underlying geology. Models for the relatively impermeable geological units plot parallel to the average indoor radon: soil ²²⁶Ra model but with lower indoor radon: soil ²²⁶Ra ratios, whilst the models for the permeable geological units plot parallel to the average indoor radon: soil ²²⁶Ra model but with higher than average indoor radon: soil ²²⁶Ra ratios.},

abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data regarding cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3{\%} per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5{\%} per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum colorectum) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0{\%} between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80{\%} of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3{\%}, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60{\%} of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.},

The relative theoretical and experimental isotopic profiles were compared and a good agreement was found. These profiles show how the isotopic composition of CO2 changes through the upper few decimeters of soil and how the amount of the isotopic fractionation is strongly influenced by soil CO2 flux. Finally, the model was used to derive the carbon isotopic composition of unfractioned deep CO2 source for all the investigated sites. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Because terrain and source characteristics make this a complex setting for this type of measurement, added consideration was given to source area and upwind fetch. Footprint analysis suggests that the eddy covariance measurements were representative of an upwind elliptical source area (3.8 ?? 103 m2) which can vary with mean wind direction, surface roughness, and atmospheric stability. CO2 flux averaged 8-16 mg m-2 s-1 (0.7-1.4 kg m-2 day-1). Eddy covariance measurements of flux were compared with surface chamber measurements made in separate studies [Geophys. Res.

abstract = {This review discusses the mechanisms of generation and potential impacts of microplastics in the ocean environment. Weathering degradation of plastics on the beaches results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that are carried into water by wind or wave action. Unlike inorganic fines present in sea water, microplastics concentrate persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by partition. The relevant distribution coefficients for common POPs are several orders of magnitude in favour of the plastic medium. Consequently, the microparticles laden with high levels of POPs can be ingested by marine biota. Bioavailability and the efficiency of transfer of the ingested POPs across trophic levels are not known and the potential damage posed by these to the marine ecosystem has yet to be quantified and modelled. Given the increasing levels of plastic pollution of the oceans it is important to better understand the impact of microplastics in the ocean food web. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Migration has long had an impact on spatial segregation within the metropolitan area of Athens. This process has also been affected by local economic restructuring mechanisms, which, in recent years, have evolved within the context of the 2008 economic crisis. This study attempts to shed light on the evolution of the spatial segregation of immigrants within the metropolitan area of Athens, during a period of a rapid urban transformation, using data from the last two census waves (2001 and 2011). Given that previous evidence indicates both vertical segregation in the immigrant labour market structure and diffused immigrant settlements, the work presented here investigates the ways in which urban migrant structures have evolved through local economic restructuring processes, as well as throughout space. The study presents a set of quantitative urban segregation indicators, covering the aspects of evenness, exposure, concentration, and centralisation. It also captures the most significant occupational changes between different migrant-status groups (non-EU and EU immigrants), during a crucial period for Athens. Evidence indicates that there has been an overall raise in immigrant settlement segregation, accompanied by an increased centralisation trend. Moreover, the urban transformation through economic restructuring that took place in Athens, following the general EU trend towards a knowledge-based economic model, has altered the immigrant labour market structure, leading to vertical segregation patterns, driven by professionalisation.},

abstract = {Two soil gas surveys were carried out in May and September 1998 at Miyakejima volcano, in the Izu Mariana arc, Japan. CO2 flux values for May and September surveys ranged from 0.1 to 18,150 g m-2 day-1 and from 0.1 to 9685 g m-2 day-1, respectively. Statistical graphical analysis showed three overlapping populations. The spatial distribution of these emissions correlated quite closely with the geothermal and geological characteristics of the studied area. The structure releasing higher CO2 is the summit cone Oyama and surrounding areas, where the most obvious geothermal features occur. A total output about 100-150 t day-1 is estimated from this area. A good correlation was observed between soil CO2 flux and soil temperature at the summit caldera indicating extensive condensation of fumarolic steam within the upper part of Miyakejima. Carbon isotopic analysis of selected samples inside the summit caldera ($\delta$13C-CO2 = - 0.90‰ to - 5.70‰) suggests a mixing of carbon derived from marine limestone and magmatic CO2 while a clear biogenic origin ($\delta$13C-CO2 = - 14.76‰ to - 25.52‰) is observed for the diffuse degassing of CO2 outside summit caldera. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Radon gas is the most important source of natural radioactivity. It is a radioactive noble gas that emanates from the ground. Radon concentrations in outdoor air are low, but in underground mines or inside houses radon concentrations can reach high levels. The biologic effects of radon are mostly due to its decay products. These are solid heavy metal isotopes that are themselves radioactive. They can be deposited on the bronchial epithelium, where they emit ionizing radiation in the form of $\alpha$-particles. Alpha radiation can effectively cause permanent damage to the DNA and can eventually lead to cancer. Epidemiological studies have given conclusive evidence that radon is carcinogenic to humans and can cause lung cancer. The first studies were performed in underground miners exposed to high levels of radon. Later studies performed in the general population showed that radon can cause lung cancer even at the lower concentrations found in houses. This indoor radon exposure is currently estimated to contribute to 5–10{\%} of lung cancer deaths.},

abstract = {Soil-gas measurements of different gas species were performed in two distinct areas of the Corinth Gulf Rift (Greece): the Aigion-Neos Erineos-Lambiri (ANEL) fault zone and the Rion-Patras fault zone. Both zones lie in one of the most seismically active areas of the Euro-Mediterranean region, where a fast-opening continental rift is located. In particular, the geochemical investigations were focused on fault segments and fracture systems previously inferred by geomorphological, lithological and structural studies.In this work the applicability of soil-gas geochemistry surveys for the exploration of buried/hidden faults was tested by using various statistical methods. Moreover, a comprehensive geostatistical treatment of the collected data provided new insights into the control exerted by active structures on deep-seated gas migration towards the surface. In both investigated areas, the highest 222Rn and CO2 concentration peaks correspond with zones where the interaction among fracture and fault segments was inferred by structural and morphological methods. This indicates a clear correlation between the shape and orientation of the anomalies and the different attitude and kinematic behavior of the faults recognized in the two areas. Furthermore, obtained results show that gases migrate preferentially through zones of brittle deformation by advective processes, as suggested by the relatively high rate of migration needed to obtain anomalies of short-lived 222Rn in the soil pores.},

abstract = {This dissertation studies the transnational ties between the Kurdistan Region in Iraq and Sweden with a particular focus on how these ties affect migration. Further, it analyses how the transnational ties between Kurds in Sweden and their relatives in the Kurdistan Region in Iraq have evolved during the past three decades. During this time, the Kurdistan region has moved from an extremely difficult situation with high levels of violence, close to economic collapse and grim outlooks, to a situation characterised by a booming economy, high levels of security, and optimism about the future. The dissertation looks at the importance of transnational practices for the creation, the direction and the perpetuation of migration with empiric evidence from the migration corridor between Iraq and Sweden and through a case study of the transnational ties forged between Kurdish immigrants in Uppsala and their families and relatives in the Kurdistan Region in Iraq. Support is found for a network effect on migration from Iraq to Sweden. The existence of a Kurdish population in Sweden and their transnational ties are indeed important in explaining asylum migration from Iraq to Sweden. Evidence is also presented that the social networks created by former asylum seekers influence more recent labour immigration from Iraq to Sweden. Moreover, it is concluded that transnational practices, including the sending of remittances, will continue to be carried out for many years to come, and the resulting transnational ties will facilitate and encourage migration between the Kurdistan Region in Iraq and Sweden in the future. i},

abstract = {Introduction: Walled off was first described by Connor et al. In 2005 and is defined as a late complication of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Aim: Present a case treated in our service of general surgery. Background: ANCs that acquire a wall of reactive tissue are called WON. This term is self-explanatory and denotes the presence of necrosis with a reactive enhancing wall. This process usually takes 3e4 weeks and only arises in the setting of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Method: Retrospective study. Results: A 29-year-old obese female patient, with situs totalis inversis, entered the service with the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis of biliary origin. The patient was managed in the intensive care unit 12 days and then the general ward. On the 31st day of illness, infectious cases, the tomography is repeated, evidencing the presence of walled off of approximately 20cm, retrogastric. Emergency surgery is decided to drain the walled off. At the operative finding: 800 cc of candid pus, cystogastroanastomosis is performed and culture is returned: Candida no albicans and is discharged on the twelfth postoperative day. Discussion: The walled off occurs in an average of 3{\%} of patients with acute pancreatitis after four weeks. There are several drainage procedures, these can be percutaneous, endoscopic or surgical, the choice of procedure depends on the experience and preference of different hospital centers. Conclusion: :Walled off is an entity that presents in late stages of acute pancreatitis, whose treatment must be surgical, being the referral to the digestive tract plus necrosectomy, the treatment of choice.},

abstract = {Ionising radiation can transfer sufficient energy to ionise molecules, and this can lead to chemical changes, including DNA damage in cells. Key evidence for the carcinogenicity of ionising radiation comes from: follow-up studies of the survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan; other epidemiological studies of groups that have been exposed to radiation from medical, occupational or environmental sources; experimental animal studies; and studies of cellular responses to radiation. Considering exposure to environmental ionising radiation, inhalation of naturally occurring radon is the major source of radiation in the population - in doses orders of magnitude higher than those from nuclear power production or nuclear fallout. Indoor exposure to radon and its decay products is an important cause of lung cancer; radon may cause approximately one in ten lung cancers in Europe. Exposures to radon in buildings can be reduced via a three-step process of identifying those with potentially elevated radon levels, measuring radon levels, and reducing exposure by installation of remediation systems. In the 4th Edition of the European Code against Cancer it is therefore recommended to: "Find out if you are exposed to radiation from naturally high radon levels in your home. Take action to reduce high radon levels". Non-ionising types of radiation (those with insufficient energy to ionise molecules) - including extremely low-frequency electric and magnetic fields as well as radiofrequency electromagnetic fields - are not an established cause of cancer and are therefore not addressed in the recommendations to reduce cancer risk.},

abstract = {Groundwater Rn concentration has been monitored at several sites in the Campi Flegrei Caldera since the time of the last episode of bradyseismic activity. The results concerning the period 1983-88 indicate that the Rn concentration is spatially variable due to the different chemico-physical characteristics of the waters or structural features. Rn concentration is generally influenced by the long-term changes of meteorological factors. Rainfalls appear to affect the Rn content of the most superficial aquifers. Several short-term spike-like Rn anomalies have been detected both during and after the period of the bradyseismic crisis. They do not show correlation with temporal changes of the pH and/or temperature of waters. A systematic correlation between Rn anomalies and episodic strong rainfall events is also absent. Furthermore, a clear relationship between Rn spikes and both uplift velocity changes and seismic activity has not been found. The overall evidence makes it very difficult to understand the temporal changes of groundwater Rn concentration that have occurred during and after the 1982-84 bradyseismic crisis. Nevertheless, a clear causal relationship between Rn concentration and the dynamics of the bradyseism is observed in some monitored sites. Its appearance may have been favoured by the low Rn concentration in the ground-waters during periods of quiescent activity.},

But, their generation, fate, fragmentation and their propensity to sorb/release persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are determined by the characteristics of the polymers that constitutes them. Yet, physico-chemical characteristics of the polymers making up the MPs have not received detailed attention in published work. This review assesses the relevance of selected characteristics of plastics that composes the microplastics, to their role as a pollutant with potentially serious ecological impacts. Fragmentation leading to secondary microplastics is also discussed underlining the likelihood of a surface-ablation mechanism that can lead to preferential formation of smaller sized MPs.},

abstract = {Soil respiration is the primary path by which CO2 fixed by land plants returns to the atmosphere. Estimated at approximately 75 × 1015gC/yr, this large natural flux is likely to increase due changes in the Earth's condition. The objective of this paper is to provide a brief scientific review for policymakers who are concerned that changes in soil respiration may contribute to the rise in CO2in Earth's atmosphere. Rising concentrations of CO2in the atmosphere will increase the flux of CO2from soils, while simultaneously leaving a greater store of carbon in the soil. Traditional tillage cultivation and rising temperature increase the flux of CO2from soils without increasing the stock of soil organic matter. Increasing deposition of nitrogen from the atmosphere may lead to the sequestration of carbon in vegetation and soils. The response of the land biosphere to simultaneous changes in all of these factors is unknown, but a large increase in the soil carbon pool seems unlikely to moderate the rise in atmospheric CO2during the next century.},

abstract = {Radon is a natural gas known to be the main contributor to natural background radiation exposure and only second to smoking as major leading cause of lung cancer. The main concern is in indoor environments where the gas tends to accumulate and can reach high concentrations. The primary contributor of this gas into the building is from the soil although architectonic characteristics, such as building materials, can largely affect concentration values. Understanding the factors affecting the concentration in dwellings and workplaces is important both in prevention, when the construction of a new building is being planned, and in mitigation when the amount of Radon detected inside a building is too high. In this paper we investigate how several factors, such as geologic typologies of the soil and a range of building characteristics, impact on indoor concentration focusing, in particular, on how concentration changes as a function of the floor level. Adopting a mixed effects model to account for the hierarchical nature of the data, we also quantify the extent to which such measurable factors manage to explain the variability of indoor radon concentration.},

abstract = {The Tso Morari serpentinites in the Ladakh area, northwest Himalaya, originated from the forearc mantle overlying the northward subducting Neo-Tethys lithosphere and the margin of the Indian continent. The serpentinites are characterized by high concentration of fluid-mobile elements (FME: As, Sb, B, Li, and U) compared to ophiolitic or abyssal serpentinites. The Pb isotopic compositions of serpentinites show influence of the subducted Indian continental lithosphere. Trace element concentrations of antigorite determined in situ with Laser Ablation High Resolution Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometer (LA-HR-ICP-MS) show high contents of FME including Pb, in contrast to the spatially associated iron oxides. Rare earth elements (REE) and compatible elements, such as Sc and Co, remained immobile during the hydration, allowing the identification of the primary minerals (olivine or orthopyroxene) from which serpentine formed. Serpentinized olivine displays higher Sb and As concentrations (up to 1000 × PM) than serpentinized orthopyroxenes that are enriched in Pb, Cs and Li (2 to up to 10 × PM). We propose that the observed FME distribution in two types of serpentine reflect the differential incorporation of FME during the downward movement of the serpentinite along the subduction plane. At temperature lower than 400 °C, at shallow depths, olivine is preferentially serpentinized and incorporates elements that are fluid soluble at low temperatures, such as Sb and As. Above 400 °C, orthopyroxene is hydrated and incorporates Pb, Cs, Li and possibly Ba. Boron and U are incorporated in both types of serpentine suggesting that they are released from slabs at temperatures around 300-400 °C. The serpentine acts as a sink for water, but also for FME and transports them to deeper and hotter levels in the mantle, down to the isotherm 600-650 °C where dehydration occurs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This review of 68 studies compares the method-ologies used for the identification and quantification of micro-plastics from the marine environment. Three main sampling strategies were identified: selective, volume-reduced, and bulk sampling. Most sediment samples came from sandy beaches at the high tide line, and most seawater samples were taken at the sea surface using neuston nets. Four steps were distinguished during sample processing: density separation, filtration, sieving, and visual sorting of microplastics. Visual sorting was one of the most commonly used methods for the identification of micro-plastics (using type, shape, degradation stage, and color as criteria). Chemical and physical characteristics (e.g., specific density) were also used. The most reliable method to identify the chemical composition of microplastics is by infrared spectroscopy. Most studies reported that plastic fragments were polyethylene and polypropylene polymers. Units commonly used for abundance estimates are " items per m 2 " for sediment and sea surface studies and " items per m 3 " for water column studies. Mesh size of sieves and filters used during sampling or sample processing influence abundance estimates. Most studies reported two main size ranges of microplastics: (i) 500 $\mu$m−5 mm, which are retained by a 500 $\mu$m sieve/net, and (ii) 1−500 $\mu$m, or fractions thereof that are retained on filters. We recommend that future programs of monitoring continue to distinguish these size fractions, but we suggest standardized sampling procedures which allow the spatiotemporal comparison of microplastic abundance across marine environments.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Exposure to high concentrations of radon progeny (radon) produces lung cancer in both underground miners and experimentally exposed laboratory animals. To determine the risk posed by residential radon exposure, the authors performed a population-based, case-control epidemiologic study in Iowa from 1993 to 1997. Subjects were female Iowa residents who had occupied their current home for at least 20 years. A total of 413 lung cancer cases and 614 age-frequency-matched controls were included in the final analysis. Excess odds were calculated per 11 working-level months for exposures that occurred 5-19 years (WLM(5-19)) prior to diagnosis for cases or prior to time of interview for controls. Eleven WLM(5-19) is approximately equal to an average residential radon exposure of 4 pCl/liter (148 Bq/m3) during this period. After adjustment for age, smoking, and education, the authors found excess odds of 0.50 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.004, 1.81) and 0.83 (95{\%} percent confidence interval: 0.11, 3.34) using categorical radon exposure estimates for all cases and for live cases, respectively. Slightly lower excess odds of 0.24 (95 percent confidence interval: -0.05, 0.92) and 0.49 (95 percent confidence interval: 0.03, 1.84) per 11 WLM(5-19) were noted for continuous radon exposure estimates for all subjects and live subjects only. The observed risk estimates suggest that cumulative ambient radon exposure presents an important environmental health hazard.},

This bias obscures a proper understanding of the developmental causes and consequences of migration at the sending end. The reciprocal migration-development relationship is examined through the discussion of seven migration 'myths'. Because of its profound developmental roots, it is useless to think that migration can be halted or that aid and trade are short-cut 'solutions' to immigration. Migrant remittances contribute significantly to development and living conditions in sending countries. Nevertheless, the recent 'remittance euphoria' is not justified, because unattractive investment environments and restrictive immigration policies which interrupt circular migration patterns prevent the high development potential of migration from being fully realised. Although specific policies can enhance this potential through facilitating remittance transfers and investments, the key lies in encouraging circular migration. Instead of uselessly and harmfully trying to stop inevitable migration, immigration policies allowing for freer circulation can, besides increasing migration control, enhance the vital contribution of migrants to the development of their home countries. {\textcopyright} 2005 Third World Quarterly.},

abstract = {Spatially distributed modelling is an important instrument for studying the hydrological cycle, both concerning its present state as well as possible future changes in climate and land use. Results of such simulations are particularly relevant for the fields of water resources, natural hazards and hydropower. The semi-distributed hydrological modelling system PREVAH (PREecipitation-Runoff-EVApotranspiration HRU Model) implements a conceptual process-oriented approach and has been developed especially to suit conditions in mountainous environments with their highly variable environmental and climatic conditions. This article presents an overview of the actual model core of PREVAH and introduces the various tools which have been developed for obtaining a comprehensive, user-friendly modelling system: DATAWIZARD for importing and managing hydrometeorological data, WINMET for pre-processing meteorological data, GRIDMATH for carrying out elementary raster data operations, FAOSOIL for processing FAO World Soil Map information, WINHRU for pre-processing spatial data and aggregating hydrological response units (HRU), WINPREVAH for operating the model, HYDROGRAPH for visualising hydrograph data and VIEWOPTIM for visualising the calibration procedure. The PREVAH components introduced here support a modelling task from pre-processing the data over the actual model calibration and validation to visualising and interpreting the results (post-processing). A brief overview of current PREVAH applications demonstrates the flexibility of the modelling system with examples that range from water balance modelling over flood estimation and flood forecasting to drought analysis in Switzerland, Austria, China, Russia and Sweden. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Italy is one of the most promising prone areas to study the CO2 behavior underground, the caprock integrity to the CO2 leakage, mostly in presence of pervious/geochemically active faults, due to a wide availability of CO2 rich reservoirs at a depth between 1 and 10 km, as highlighted by recent literature. These deep CO2 reservoirs generate at least 200 leakage areas at surface throughout Italy which have been defined "Diffuse Degassing Structures" (DDS) by INGV. These are widely studied by INGV institutionally by a long term convention with the Civil Protection Department (DPC) with the aim to catalog, monitor and assess the Natural Gas Hazard (NGH, namely the probability of an area to become a site of poisonous peri-volcanic gas exhalation from soils). More than 150 researcher of INGV are involved in monitoring areas affected by the CO2 presence underground and at surface, by continuous monitoring on-line networks (around 40 stations throughout Italy, including the Etna area, Aeolian Islands, Umbria region, Piemonte region, etc.) and discretely (9 groups of research were involved in the last years to localize, define and monitor almost all the DDSs in Italy), by sampling and analyzing chemical and isotopic compounds, useful to discriminate the origin, evolution and natural gas hazards of the examined DDS. In this paper, we will discuss some DDS catalogued and studied by a Rome INGV Research Unit (UR 11) which focused its work in Central Italy, throughout different DDS, also in relation to the diverse seismotectonic settings, to discover buried faults as possible gas leakage pathways, mostly if they are "geochemically" activated. In particular we discuss, among the discrete monitoring techniques exploited by INGV, soil gas surveying, which consists in a collection of gas samples from the soil zone not saturated (dry zone) to measure the geogas gaseous species both in fluxes (CO2, CH4, 222Rn) and in concentration (He, H2, H2S, helium, hydrogen, CO2, CH4, 222Rn), that permeate the soil pores. The total CO2 flux budget was calculated as "baseline" degassing rate of these " CO2 analogues". A good discrete areal monitoring is prerequisite to design sound continuous monitoring network to monitor CO2 related parameters in liquid/gas phases, to review the protocol of the Annex II of the European Directivity on CCS. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Carbon dioxide soil flux has been used for many years to monitor Italian active volcanoes and both the active Dynamic Concentration (DCM) and the passive Accumulation Chamber (ACM) methods are employed. These two methods have been compared by means of 218 simultaneous flux measurements carried out in the La Fossa area of Vulcano Island, where a large variation of CO2 soil release occurs. Results indicate that DCM overestimates CO2 flux and is proportional to it only in high flux zones (flux higher than 100 gm -2 day-1). Using ACM fluxes and the Stefan-Maxwell equation, the measured CO2/depth curves in the soil could be reproduced. In high flux points CO2 is transported mostly by viscous flow up to a very shallow depth and then by diffusive flow, which is the dominant gas transport mechanism in low flux points. Carbon dioxide soil flux values are controlled by proximity to active gas releasing fractures, by changes in the barometric pressure and by variations in soil permeability. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract  In a context of climate change peatlands may switch from a sink to a source of carbon (C). The induced positive feedbacks are closely linked to C dynamics, and thus to the fate of organic matter (OM) in the underlying peat. Our aims were to determine how moisture conditions in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland affect the dynamics of diagenetic sensitive OM which is thought to be the most reactive to warming effects. The approach was based on the identification of combined bulk and molecular bioindicators of OM sources and decay of peat profiles (up to 50 cm in depth) from two moisture conditions of the Le Forbonnet peatland (Jura Mountains, France). The ratio derived from the analysis of neutral monosaccharides was used to obtain indications on the botanical origin of the peat and tended to indicate a greater contribution of Cyperaceae in the deepest parts of the peat. Most bioindicators showed that OM decay increased with depth and was higher in the driest conditions. In these conditions, decay was shown by a loss of diagenetic sensitive oxygen-rich OM, probably leached by water table fluctuations. Decay intensity was also shown by the high ribose and lyxose contents at the peat surface, where microscopic observations also revealed relatively large quantities of fungal hyphae. The sugars could have arisen from microbial synthesis, primarily protozoan and fungal activity. These results suggest that water level changes preferentially impact biochemical changes in diagenetic sensitive OM, believed to be sensitive to drought events.},

abstract = {Radon is a noble gas that occurs in nature as a decay product of uranium. Radon is the principal contributor to natural background radiation and is considered to be one of the major leading causes of lung cancer. The main concern revolves around indoor environments where radon accumulates and reaches high concentrations. In this paper, a semiparametric random-effect M-quantile model is introduced to model radon concentration inside a building, and a way to estimate the model within the framework of robust maximum likelihood is presented. Using data collected in a monitoring survey carried out in the Lombardy Region (Italy) in 2003–2004, we investigate the impact of a number of factors, such as geological typologies of the soil and building characteristics, on indoor concentration. The proposed methodology permits the identification of building typologies prone to a high concentration of the pollutant. It is shown how these effects are largely not constant across the entire distribution of indoor radon concentration, making the suggested approach preferable to ordinary regression techniques since high concentrations are usually of concern. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our model provides a natural way of identifying those areas more prone to high concentration, displaying them by thematic maps. Understanding how buildings' characteristics affect indoor concentration is fundamental both for preventing the gas from accumulating in new buildings and for mitigating those situations where the amount of radon detected inside a building is too high and has to be reduced.},

abstract = {In semi-arid regions of Central Asia, water shortage results from low annual precipitation (P) with high interannual variability. Evapotranspiration (ET) dominates water balance losses entirely. Previous studies showed large differences between individual grassland sites in the partitioning of ET into evaporation and transpiration, but only little difference in the evaporative ratio ET/P. The hydrological model BROOK90 was applied to the Xilin river catchment in Inner Mongolia (China) in combination with data from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and ET measurements. The ET part of the model was parameterised using several years of eddy covariance (EC) measurements over grasslands differing in grazing intensity and leaf area index (LAI). Using a relatively well-established relationship of LAI and P as well as LAI and temperature derived from MODIS, the water balance components of a 16 kmA(2) sample area in the catchment were modelled with a 1 kmA(2) resolution for the vegetation period of 2006. All pixels were modelled assuming a similar ET control as at the EC sites. Spatial variation in ET as well as in the partitioning of ET between transpiration and evaporation could be identified. The results indicate the potential of using MODIS data and BROOK90 to upscale ET of semi-arid grasslands from site to larger grass dominated catchments.},

abstract = {Migration has long had an impact on spatial segregation within the metropolitan area of Athens. This process has also been affected by local economic restructuring mechanisms, which, in recent years, have evolved within the context of the 2008 economic crisis. This study attempts to shed light on the evolution of the spatial segregation of immigrants within the metropolitan area of Athens, during a period of a rapid urban transformation, using data from the last two census waves (2001 and 2011). Given that previous evidence indicates both vertical segregation in the immigrant labour market structure and diffused immigrant settlements, the work presented here investigates the ways in which urban migrant structures have evolved through local economic restructuring processes, as well as throughout space. The study presents a set of quantitative urban segregation indicators, covering the aspects of evenness, exposure, concentration, and centralisation. It also captures the most significant occupational changes between different migrant-status groups (non-EU and EU immigrants), during a crucial period for Athens. Evidence indicates that there has been an overall raise in immigrant settlement segregation, accompanied by an increased centralisation trend. Moreover, the urban transformation through economic restructuring that took place in Athens, following the general EU trend towards a knowledge-based economic model, has altered the immigrant labour market structure, leading to vertical segregation patterns, driven by professionalisation.},

abstract = {The speciation of dissolved and particulate Ni has been determined along an axial transect of the Beaulieu Estuary, southern England, using adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (ACSV). Total dissolved concentrations ranged from about 80 nM in the river end-member to about 15 nM in the marine end-member, and the ACSV-non-labile fraction, comprising Ni complexes whose alpha coefficients exceed 109.2, contributed between about 15 and 60{\%} of the total dissolved pool. The axial distributions of total dissolved Ni and species thereof, and dissolved organic carbon, could be defined in terms of simple end-member mixing, suggesting little biogeochemical reactivity in the estuary. Particulate Ni was dominated (??? 70{\%}) by the fraction available to acetic acid, and a distinct seaward decrease from about 35 to 2 ??g g-1 could, likewise, be largely accounted for by mixing of (particle) end-members of different composition. The uptake of Ni by Beaulieu particles was monitored in a series of laboratory simulations employing 63Ni and liquid scintillation counting. Adsorption was dependent to some degree on salinity, pH and particle type, but most importantly on the presence of dissolved organic matter. Thus, particle-water distribution coefficients (K(D)s) were almost doubled when artificial river and sea waters, containing no pre-existing dissolved organic matter, were used in place of organic-rich Beaulieu end-members, and increased by seven-fold when UV-irradiated river water was used in place of untreated river water. These observations were interpreted in terms of the formation of small (sub-colloidal) and relatively strong organic complexes which are relatively resistant to adsorption, and a simple model was developed, incorporating the K(D)s, to predict the ratio of this fraction of dissolved Ni to the remaining fraction of dissolved Ni as a function of suspended particle concentration. The ACSV (field) measurements of labile and non-labile dissolved Ni from the Beaulieu conformed with the model prediction when K(D)s for UV-irradiated and untreated river waters were employed, implying that the ACSV-non-labile fraction of dissolved Ni (log10?? {\textgreater} 9.2) affords a good indication of the fraction which is resistant to adsorption. It is suggested that the low biogeochemical reactivity of Ni in the Beaulieu results from a combination of its low particle affinity, maintained by the presence of specific dissolved organic ligands, and small suspended sediment fluxes throughout the estuary. The distributions of Ni in other estuaries are examined and implications for the more general estuarine behaviour of Ni are discussed.},

abstract = {The assessment of the environmental impacts of CO2 geological storage requires the investigation of potential CO2 leakages into fresh groundwater, particularly with respect to protected groundwater resources. The geochemical processes and perturbations associated with a CO2 leak into fresh groundwater could alter groundwater quality: indeed, some of the reacting minerals may contain hazardous constituents, which might be released into groundwater. Since the geochemical reactions may occult direct evidence of intruding CO2, it is necessary to characterize these processes and identify possible indirect indicators for monitoring CO2 intrusion. The present study focuses on open questions: Can changes in water quality provide evidence of CO2 leakage? Which parameters can be used to assess impact on freshwater aquifers? What is the time scale of water chemistry degradation in the presence of CO2? The results of an experimental approach allow selecting pertinent isotope tracers as possible indirect indicators of CO2 presence, opening the way to devise an isotopic tracing tool.The study area is located in the Paris Basin (France), which contains deep saline formations identified as targets by French national programs for CO2 geological storage. The study focuses on the multi-layered Albian fresh water aquifer, confined in the central part of the Paris Basin a major strategic potable groundwater overlying the potential CO2 storage formations. An experimental approach (batch reactors) was carried out in order to better understand the rock-water-CO2 interactions with two main objectives. The first was to assess the evolution of the formation water chemistry and mineralogy of the solid phase over time during the interaction. The second concerned the design of an isotopic monitoring program for freshwater resources potentially affected by CO2 leakage. The main focus was to select suitable environmental isotope tracers to track water rock interaction associated with small quantities of CO2 leaking into freshwater aquifers.In order to improve knowledge on the Albian aquifer, and to provide representative samples for the experiments, solid and fluid sampling campaigns were performed throughout the Paris Basin. Albian groundwater is anoxic with high concentrations of Fe, a pH around 7 and a mineral content of 0.3gL-1. Macroscopic and microscopic solid analyses showed a quartz-rich sand with the presence of illite/smectite, microcline, apatite and glauconite. A water-mineral-CO2 interaction batch experiment was used to investigate the geochemical evolution of the groundwater and the potential release of hazardous trace elements. It was complemented by a multi-isotope approach including ??13CDIC and 87Sr/86Sr. Here the evolution of the concentrations of major and trace elements and isotopic ratios over batch durations from 1day to 1month are discussed. Three types of ion behavior are observed: Type I features Ca, SiO2, HCO3, F, PO4, Na, Al, B, Co, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, Zn which increased after initial CO2 influx. Type II comprises Be and Fe declining at the start of CO2 injection. Then, type III groups element with no variation during the experiments like Cl and SO4. The results of the multi-isotope approach show significant changes in isotopic ratios with time. The contribution of isotope and chemical data helps in understanding geochemical processes involved in the system. The isotopic systems used in this study are potential indirect indicators of CO2-water-rock interaction and could serve as monitoring tools of CO2 leakage into an aquifer overlying deep saline formations used for C sequestration and storage. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Average values for sites are 0.20 for 222Rn and 0.16 for 220Rn. Based on distribution of 226Ra among the exchangeable, organic, Fe-oxide, sand, silt and clay fractions of the soils, a multiple regression indicates that the organic-exchangeable fraction, occurring mainly as coatings on grains, has an emanation coefficient for 222Rn of 0.46, and the silt-clay fraction has an emanation coefficient of 0.22. The latter value is verified by experiments. The organic component makes the largest single contribution to Rn in soil gas. Mineral grains have twice the 222Rn emanation as 220Rn, implying that about half the Rn atoms are emanated directly to pore space, and the remainder are freed by track-etching and diffusion over a period of days. Emanation for 220Rn appears to be dominated by Fe-oxides, the main host for pedogenic 232Th. Surface A- and E-horizons have low emanation coefficients for {\{}Su220{\}}Rn, probably because of a lack of Fe-oxides in these horizons.},

abstract = {Samples representing part of a whole, usually called compositional data in statistics, are commonplace in analytical chemistry--say chemical data in percentage, ppm, or $\mu$g g(-1). Their distinctive feature is that there is an inherent relationship between all the analytes constituting a chemical sample as they only convey relative information. Some compositional data analysis principles and the log-ratio based methodology are outlined here in practical terms. Besides, one often finds that some analytes are not present in sufficient concentration in a sample to allow the measuring instruments to effectively detect them. These non-detects are usually labelled as "{\textless}DL" (less-thans) in the data set, indicating that the values are below known detection limits. Many data analysis techniques require complete data sets. Thus, there is a need of sensible replacement strategies for less-thans. The peculiar nature of compositional data determines any data analysis and demands for a specialised treatment of less-thans that, unfortunately, is not usually covered in chemometrics. Some well-founded statistical methods are revisited in this paper aiming to prevent practitioners from relying on popular but untrustworthy approaches. A new proposal to estimate less-thans combining a log-normal probability model and a multiplicative modification of the samples is also introduced. Their performance is illustrated and compared on a real data set, and guidelines are provided for practitioners. Matlab and R code implementing the methods are made available for the reader.},

abstract = {Closed (non-steady state) chambers are widely used for quantifying carbon dioxide (CO 2) fluxes between soils or low-stature canopies and the atmosphere. It is well recognised that covering a soil or vegetation by a closed chamber inherently disturbs the natural CO 2 fluxes by al-tering the concentration gradients between the soil, the veg-etation and the overlying air. Thus, the driving factors of CO 2 fluxes are not constant during the closed chamber ex-periment, and no linear increase or decrease of CO 2 con-centration over time within the chamber headspace can be expected. Nevertheless, linear regression has been applied for calculating CO 2 fluxes in many recent, partly influential, studies. This approach has been justified by keeping the clo-sure time short and assuming the concentration change over time to be in the linear range. Here, we test if the application of linear regression is really appropriate for estimating CO 2 fluxes using closed chambers over short closure times and if the application of nonlinear regression is necessary. We de-veloped a nonlinear exponential regression model from dif-fusion and photosynthesis theory. This exponential model was tested with four different datasets of CO 2 flux measure-ments (total number: 1764) conducted at three peatlands sites in Finland and a tundra site in Siberia. Thorough analy-ses of residuals demonstrated that linear regression was fre-quently not appropriate for the determination of CO 2 fluxes by closed-chamber methods, even if closure times were kept short. The developed exponential model was well suited for nonlinear regression of the concentration over time c(t) evo-Correspondence to: L. Kutzbach (kutzbach@uni-greifswald.de) lution in the chamber headspace and estimation of the initial CO 2 fluxes at closure time for the majority of experiments. However, a rather large percentage of the exponential regres-sion functions showed curvatures not consistent with the the-oretical model which is considered to be caused by viola-tions of the underlying model assumptions. Especially the effects of turbulence and pressure disturbances by the cham-ber deployment are suspected to have caused unexplainable curvatures. CO 2 flux estimates by linear regression can be as low as 40{\%} of the flux estimates of exponential regression for closure times of only two minutes. The degree of under-estimation increased with increasing CO 2 flux strength and was dependent on soil and vegetation conditions which can disturb not only the quantitative but also the qualitative eval-uation of CO 2 flux dynamics. The underestimation effect by linear regression was observed to be different for CO 2 uptake and release situations which can lead to stronger bias in the daily, seasonal and annual CO 2 balances than in the individ-ual fluxes. To avoid serious bias of CO 2 flux estimates based on closed chamber experiments, we suggest further tests us-ing published datasets and recommend the use of nonlinear regression models for future closed chamber studies.},

abstract = {We evaluate the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas obtained by high-volume hydraulic fracturing from shale formations, focusing on methane emissions. Natural gas is composed largely of methane, and 3.6{\%} to 7.9{\%} of the methane from shale-gas production escapes to the atmosphere in venting and leaks over the life-time of a well. These methane emissions are at least 30{\%} more than and perhaps more than twice as great as those from conventional gas. The higher emissions from shale gas occur at the time wells are hydraulically fractured—as methane escapes from flow-back return fluids—and during drill out following the fracturing. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential that is far greater than that of carbon dioxide, particularly over the time horizon of the first few decades following emission. Methane contributes substantially to the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas on shorter time scales, dominating it on a 20-year time horizon. The footprint for shale gas is greater than that for conventional gas or oil when viewed on any time horizon, but particularly so over 20 years. Compared to coal, the footprint of shale gas is at least 20{\%} greater and perhaps more than twice as great on the 20-year horizon and is comparable when compared over 100 years.},

Drawing on life history interviews with migrant and non-migrant families, we explore the role of migration and commuting in addressing livelihood vulnerability along a rural–urban continuum in Karnataka, India. We find that labelling migration as an adaptation strategy or not does not necessarily capture the breadth of experiences and implications for livelihoods that migrants and their families face. At an intra-household level, migration and commuting can alleviate vulnerability for some family members while exacerbating vulnerability of others. At a larger scale, migration that is adaptive at a household scale can be maladaptive at a system scale, where cities are unable to provide for or absorb migrants who often live in highly vulnerable conditions. Finally, on a temporal scale, migration and commuting affect livelihood trajectories and choices beyond the migrants alone, and understanding how these strategies affect household vulnerability over time is crucial for adaptation research. We also highlight the use of life histories as a methodological tool that complements current econometric approaches exploring migration and allows for in-depth and temporally sensitive inquiry into the drivers and consequences of migration.},

DESIGN Cost effectiveness analysis. SETTING United Kingdom. DATA SOURCES Epidemiological data on risks from indoor radon and from smoking, vital statistics on deaths from lung cancer, survey information on effectiveness and costs of radon prevention and remediation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Estimated number of deaths from lung cancer related to indoor radon, lifetime risks of death from lung cancer before and after various potential interventions to control radon, the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from different policies for control of radon, and the potential of those policies to reduce lung cancer mortality. RESULTS The mean radon concentration in UK homes is 21 becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m(3)). Each year around 1100 deaths from lung cancer (3.3{\%} of all deaths from lung cancer) are related to radon in the home. Over 85{\%} of these arise from radon concentrations below 100 Bq/m(3) and most are caused jointly by radon and active smoking. Current policy requiring basic measures to prevent radon in new homes in selected areas is highly cost effective, and such measures would remain cost effective if extended to the entire UK, with a cost per QALY gained of pound11,400 ( euro12 200; {\$}16,913). Current policy identifying and remediating existing homes with high radon levels is, however, neither cost effective (cost per QALY gained pound36,800) nor effective in reducing lung cancer mortality. CONCLUSIONS Policies requiring basic preventive measures against radon in all new homes throughout the UK would be cost effective and could complement existing policies to reduce smoking. Policies involving remedial work on existing homes with high radon levels cannot prevent most radon related deaths, as these are caused by moderate exposure in many homes. These conclusions are likely to apply to most developed countries, many with higher mean radon concentrations than the UK.},

abstract = {Due to limitations of chemical analysis procedures, small concentrations cannot be precisely measured. These concentrations are said to be below the limit of detection (LOD). In statistical analyses, these values are often censored and substituted with a constant value, such as half the LOD, the LOD divided by the square root of 2, or zero. These methods for handling below-detection values results in two distributions, a uniform distribution for those values below the LOD, and the true distribution. As a result, this can produce questionable descriptive statistics depending upon the percentage of values below the LOD. An alternative method uses the characteristics of the distribution of the values above the LOD to estimate the values below the LOD. This can be done with an extrapolation technique or maximum likelihood estimation. An example program using the same data is presented calculating the mean, standard deviation, t-test, and relative difference in the means for various methods and compares the results. The extrapolation and maximum likelihood estimate techniques have smaller error rates than all the standard replacement techniques. Although more computational, these methods produce more reliable descriptive statistics.},

abstract = {Zircon, the main mineral of zirconium, is a silicate mineral product (ZrSi0 4) obtained from beach sand deposits, along with other minerals such as kyanite, ilmenite, and rutile. All zircons contain some radioactive impurities due to the presence of uranium, thorium and their respective decay products in the crystalline structure of zircon, as well as potassium-40. Uranium and thorium substitute Zr 4: in the mineral through an internal process called isomorphous replacement of zirconium. For this study, samples were collected both from a mineral sand processing plant located in the coastal region of Northeastern Brazil and from the beach sands used in the process. The aim of this study was to assess the 238 U, 232 Th, and 40 K contents in the beach sands and in the mineral products extracted from the sands in that facility, with special emphasis on zircon. Measurements were performed through gamma spectrometry, by using a high-purity germanium detector (HPGe) coupled to a multichannel analyzer. Activity concentrations for 238 U and 232 Th in zircon sands ranged from 5462±143 to 19286±46 Bq kg -1 and from 1016±7 to 7162±38 Bq kg -1 , respectively. For 40 K, on the other hand, activity concentration values ranged from 81±14 to 681±26 Bq kg -1 . The results of the measurements carried out for raw sand samples showed activity concentrations between 2.7±0.6 and 7.9±0.9 Bq kg -1 and 6.5±0.4 and 9.4±0.6 Bq kg -1 for 238 U and 232 Th, respectively, and from 48.8±3.1 to 76.1±2.4 Bq kg -for °K. Activity concentrations of U and Th in kyanite, ilmenite and rutile samples were also determined.},

abstract = {A clear and detailed understanding of gas migration mechanisms from depth to ground surface is fundamental to choose the best locations for CO2 geological storage sites, to engineer them so that they do not leak, and to select the most appropriate monitoring strategy and tools to guarantee public safety. Natural test sites (or "natural analogues") provide the best opportunity to study migration mechanisms, as they incorporate such issues as scale, long-time system evolution, and interacting variables that cannot be adequately addressed with laboratory studies or computer models. To this end the present work examines the migration to surface of deep, naturally produced CO2 along various buried and exposed faults in the Latera caldera (central Italy) by integrating structural geology and near-surface gas geochemistry surveys. Results show how gas migration is channelled along discrete, high-permeability pathways within the faults, with release typically occurring from spatially restricted gas vents. Size, distribution, and strength of these vents appear to be controlled by the evolution and deformation style of the fault, which is in turn linked to the rheology of the lithological units cut by the fault. As such gas migration can change drastically along strike. Gas migration in the vadose zone around these vents is also discussed, focussing on how the physical-chemical characteristics of various species (CO2, CH4, and He) control their spatial distribution and eventual release to the atmosphere. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Trace element contamination has been a serious problem in the vicinity of abandoned mine sites. In the studied area, mining activities have produced great amounts of wastes, characterized by high trace elements content, acidic pH and minerals from supergene alteration. Trace elements have been dispersed, both downstream and downslope from the mine mainly due, mainly, to surface run-off. Trace elements hydric mobilization usually takes place during the rainy season, an important pollution route in the studied area. A wide range of techniques have been proposed to remediate soils polluted by trace elements. Among them, phytoremediation-based technologies could provide a long-lasting solution. The aim of this work was to determine trace element concentration in roots and leaves of five plant species (Limonium carthaginens, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Dittrichia viscosa, Glaucium flavum and Zygophyllum fabago) growing in soils polluted by mining activities in order to determine which part of the plants accumulate heavy metals to the greatest extent. The metal concentrations in plants varied with plant species. Plant accumulation results showed that Z. fabago could act as an accumulator for Fe, and A. macrostachyum could accumulate in Fe, As and Mn. The other plant species collected from the mining sites were tolerant to trace element contamination. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This review presents recent concepts, understanding and experience of the restoration, recovery and human-mediated modification of estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems. It shows that these can be divided into four categories: natural recovery from a natural or anthropogenic change (whether adverse or otherwise); anthropogenic interventions in response to a degraded or anthropogenically changed environment; anthropogenic responses to a single stressor; and habitat enhancement or creation. A conceptual framework for restoration and recovery of marine marginal and semi-enclosed areas is presented after exploring and refining the plethora of terms used in restoration science and management. Examples of management action are given including managed realignment and the restoration of docks, biogenic reefs, saltmarsh, seagrass, beaches and upper estuarine water quality. We emphasise that although recovery techniques are worthwhile if they can be carried out, they rarely (if ever) fully replace lost habitat. Moreover, while they may have some success in marginal or semi-enclosed areas such as coastal bays, estuaries and fringing habitats, they are less relevant to open coastal and marine habitats. Therefore the best option available in the latter can only be to remove the stressor, as the cause of any change, to prevent other stressors from operating and to allow the conditions suitable for natural recovery. This review emphasises that whereas some ecological concepts related to restoration are well understood, for example, the nature of ecosystem structure and functioning, others such as carrying capacity, resilience and ecosystem goods and services are still poorly quantified for the marine and estuarine environments. The linking between these ecological concepts and the management framework is also relatively recent but is required to give a holistic approach to understanding, managing and manipulating these environments. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The physical properties of clay allow argillaceous formations to be considered geological barriers to radionuclide migration in high-level radioactive-waste isolation systems. As laboratory simulations are short term and numerical models always involve assumptions and simplifications of the natural system, natural analogues are extremely attractive surrogates for the study of long-term isolation. The clays of the Orciatico area (Tuscany, Central Italy), which were thermally altered via the intrusion of an alkali-trachyte laccolith, represent an interesting natural model of a heat source which acted on argillaceous materials. The study of this natural analogue was performed through detailed geoelectrical and soil-gas surveys to define both the geometry of the intrusive body and the gas permeability of a clay unit characterized by different degrees of thermal alteration. The results of this study show that gas permeability is increased in the clay sequences subjected to greater heat input from the emplacement of the Orciatico intrusion, despite the lack of apparent mineral and geotechnical variations. These results, which take into consideration long time periods in a natural, large-scale geological system, may have important implications for the long-term safety of underground storage of nuclear waste in clay formations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Radon is a natural source of radioactivity and it can be found in all soils and rocks in the Earth. The presence of radon gas in indoor environments implies a serious risk for human health, already listed as carcinogenic by the World Health Organization. The most relevant methods to infer the risk for radon exposure are based on soil radon concentration and gas permeability that describe the effective radon movement in the soil. However, they neglect crucial soil properties and water content in soil, which can affect greatly soil permeability to gases. Additionally, soil permeability measurement remains expensive, difficult and time-consuming. In this paper we show a new and simple methodology to infer radon risk based on Rosetta3 pedotransfer function as well as soil texture and water content. We also determine the influence of soil texture both on the gas permeability variation in dependence on water content and on the parameter n of the van Genuchten –Mualem model, which establishes the shape of the relative permeability curves. We show that radon risk exposure may change importantly for the same soil with different soil water contents. We finally apply and validate the proposed method using radon permeability data from the Canadian component of the North American Soil Geochemical Landscapes Project (NASGLP). Results highlight that the proposed methodology provides reliable estimations of the gas permeability and reveal that the presence of water content may cross the boundary between two radon risk categories, and consequently, may change the radon risk category to safer situations.},

Most active mud volcanoes are exhaling methane-dominated gases. Nevertheless, some gases show unusual carbon dioxide-dominated and/or nitrogen-excess compositions. This implies that there are multiple sources for the gas compositions of mud volcanoes in Taiwan. For better understanding the total amount of exhalation gases and its flux, the gas flow and compositions were continuously measured in the interval of two minutes at Chung-lun (CL) bubbling mud pool for a few months. The major compositions of gases exhaling from this site were 75 90{\%} of CO2 and 5 12{\%} of CH4 . The amount of gases exhaling from the mud pool can be estimated to be about 1.4 ton/year for CH4 and 28 ton/year for CO2 , respectively.

abstract = {[1] Soil organic matter (SOM) is a primary reservoir of terrestrial sulfur (S), but its role in the global S cycle remains poorly understood. We examine S speciation by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to describe S species behavior during SOM decomposition. Sulfur species in SOM were best represented by organic sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfonate, and sulfate. The highest fraction of S in litter was organic sulfide, but as decomposition progressed, relative fractions of sulfonate and sulfate generally increased. Over 6-month laboratory incubations, organic sulfide was most reactive, suggesting that a fraction of this species was associated with a highly labile pool of SOM. During humification, relative concentrations of sulfoxide consistently decreased, demonstrating the importance of sulfoxide as a reactive S phase in soil. Sulfonate fractional abundance increased during humification irrespective of litter type, illustrating its relative stability in soils. The proportion of S species did not differ systematically by litter type, but organic sulfide became less abundant in conifer SOM during decomposition, while sulfate fractional abundance increased. Conversely, deciduous SOM exhibited lesser or nonexistent shifts in organic sulfide and sulfate fractions during decomposition, possibly suggesting that S reactivity in deciduous litter is coupled to rapid C mineralization and independent of S speciation. All trends were consistent in soils across study sites. We conclude that S reactivity is related to speciation in SOM, particularly in conifer forests, and S species fractions in SOM change during decomposition. Our data highlight the importance of intermediate valence species (sulfoxide and sulfonate) in the pedochemical cycling of organic bound S.},

This review covers 83 studies that investigated the distribution of microplastics and the ecotoxicity of micro- and nanoplastics in marine and freshwater ecosystems. The studies indicated that micro-sized plastics and plastic debris were distributed at various concentrations in aquatic ecosystems around the world. They had various effects on the growth, development, behavior, reproduction, and mortality of aquatic animals. We discuss these studies in detail and suggest directions for future research.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate smart features required for the next generation of personal protective equipment (PPE) for firefighters in Australia, Korea, Japan, and the USA. Questionnaire responses were obtained from 167 Australian, 351 Japanese, 413 Korean, and 763 U.S. firefighters (1,611 males and 61 females). Preferences concerning smart features varied among countries, with 27{\%} of Korean and 30{\%} of U.S. firefighters identifying 'a location monitoring system' as the most important element. On the other hand, 43{\%} of Japanese firefighters preferred 'an automatic body cooling system' while 21{\%} of the Australian firefighters selected equally 'an automatic body cooling system' and 'a wireless communication system'. When asked to rank these elements in descending priority, responses across these countries were very similar with the following items ranked highest: 'a location monitoring system', 'an automatic body cooling system', 'a wireless communication system', and 'a vision support system'. The least preferred elements were 'an automatic body warming system' and 'a voice recording system'. No preferential relationship was apparent for age, work experience, gender or anthropometric characteristics. These results have implications for the development of the next generation of PPE along with the international standardisation of the smart PPE.},

These range from 6–673, 5–767, 5–1750, 6–1760 and 185–875 Bq/kg respectively. The ({\%} wt.) heavy magnetic (HM) fraction (epidote, allanite, hornblende, biotite and garnet), the heavy non-magnetic (HNM) fraction (monazite, zircon, titanite and apatite) and the total heavy (TH) fraction, were correlated with the concentrations of the measured radionuclides in the bulk samples. The HNM fraction seems to control the activity concentrations of 238U in all samples, while the HM fraction, at least for the heavy mineral rich samples bearing high amounts of epidote crystals with allanite cores, controls their 232Th content. The measured radionuclides in beach sands were normalized to the respective values measured in the granitic rocks, which are their most probable parent rocks, in order to provide data on their enrichment or depletion. The annual effective dose varies from 0.013 to 0.688 mSv y−1 for local people working on the beach, while for tourists the annual external effective dose ranges between 0.003 and 0.165 mSv y−1.},

Summary Point pattern analysis pattern comprises a series of techni-ques that enables the distribution of a series of events occu-rring in the vicinity of a particular region of a map to be stu-died. In epidemiology, this problem arises when a potential source of environmental contamination, possibly leading to cases of a specific disease, is investigated. The present study provides a brief description of point pat-tern analysis. The approach is illustrated through determina-tion of the environmental source and study of the areas of gre-atest risk of incidence of an outbreak of legionella pneumonia that occurred between the middle of September and begin-ning of October in the city of Alcoi in Alicante (Spain). Point pattern analysis was able to confirm the environmen-tal source of the outbreak and identify the areas of the city at greatest risk. This provided the justification for an exhaustive inspection of the installations generating aerosols after which, to date, the epidemics ceased.},

abstract = {Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVMs) simulate energy, water and carbon fluxes between the ecosystem and the atmosphere, between the vegetation and the soil, and between plant organs. They also estimate the potential biomass of a forest in equilibrium having grown under a given climate and atmospheric CO(2) level. In this study, we evaluate the Above Ground Woody Biomass (AGWB) and the above ground woody Net Primary Productivity (NPP(AGW)) simulated by the DVM ORCHIDEE across Amazonian forests, by comparing the simulation results to a large set of ground measurements (220 sites for biomass, 104 sites for NPPAGW). We found that the NPPAGW is on average overestimated by 63{\%}. We also found that the fraction of biomass that is lost through mortality is 85{\%} too high. These model biases nearly compensate each other to give an average simulated AGWB close to the ground measurement average. Nevertheless, the simulated AGWB spatial distribution differs significantly from the observations. Then, we analyse the discrepancies in biomass with regards to discrepancies in NPPAGW and those in the rate of mortality. When we correct for the error in NPPAGW, the errors on the spatial variations in AGWB are exacerbated, showing clearly that a large part of the misrepresentation of biomass comes from a wrong modelling of mortality processes. Previous studies showed that Amazonian forests with high productivity have a higher mortality rate than forests with lower productivity. We introduce this relationship, which results in strongly improved modelling of biomass and of its spatial variations. We discuss the possibility of modifying the mortality modelling in ORCHIDEE, and the opportunity to improve forest productivity modelling through the integration of biomass measurements, in particular from remote sensing.},

abstract = {Based on their $\delta$34S signature, sulfate minerals and native sulfur around fumaroles and hot water pools from the Campi Flegrei volcanic area derive from supergenic oxidation of volcanic H2S. Their mean $\delta$34S value (-0.2 ± 1.7‰) matches with that of fumarolic H2S at Solfatara (-0.3 ± 0.3‰), as well as with the $\delta$34S of + 1.4‰ obtained for total sulfur in fresh trachyte from the area. All $\delta$34S values indicate a mostly deep-seated origin for sulfur. Thermal waters were analysed for major and minor chemistry and for oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur isotope compositions. Pools at Pisciarelli are filled with evaporated meteoric water heated by rising (magmatic) gases. The water $\delta$18O (+ 3.8 ± 1.3‰) and $\delta$2H (+ 6.5 ± 2.2‰) values in these steam-heated waters are controlled by mixing and evaporation effects, and the $\delta$34S value of dissolved sulfate (-1.3 ± 0.3‰) basically agrees with supergenic oxidation of deep-seated H2S as the major source of sulfur. Instead, water from thermal springs and wells elsewhere in the Campi Flegrei appears to be a mixture between dilute meteoric and saline marine components. The latter may be local seawater from the bay of Pozzuoli. The $\delta$18O and $\delta$2H values of waters sampled during 1993-1994 range from -5.6 to +0.3‰ and from -33 to -3.4‰, respectively. The $\delta$34S values of dissolved sulfate range between -0.1 and +19.5‰. In general, sulfate is probably derived essentially from two sources, both within the volcanic cover, i.e., oxidation/dissolution of pyrite and anhydrite, and marine water. An occasional source of water and sulfate is represented by (magmatic) gases, which directly interact with shallow meteoric water as in the case of the Hotel Tennis well yielding steam-heated water with $\delta$18O = -1.5 ± 0.2‰, $\delta$2H = -17 ± 1‰ and $\delta$34S = -0.1‰.},

abstract = {Direct measurement of present day CH4 diffuse degassing from the soil represents an effective tool to better estimate the degassing rate of individual sources and to calibrate global Earth degassing estimates. While many data exist on CH4 emissions from ecosystems, agricultural soils and landfills, few estimates of CH4 emissions from volcanic-geothermal areas have been performed. The authors report results and discuss applications of accumulation-chamber measurements of soil CH4 and CO2 flux from Solfatara of Pozuoli (Naples), Vulcano Island and Poggio dell'Olivo (Viterbo) volcanic-geothermal areas, and the Palma Campania landfill (Naples). Volcanic-geothermal study areas are characterised by vent discharges of fluids with different CH4/CO2 ratios (from 4.7??10-5 to 7.5??10-5, 4.7??10-4 and 2.5??10-3 by weight, for Solfatara of Pozzuoli, Vulcano island, and Poggio dell'Olivo areas, respectively). Soil CH4 fluxes range from 0.003 to 48 g m-2 day-1 in the volcanic-geothermal areas and from 0.0021 to 936 g m-2 day-1 in the landfill, with high spatial variability observed in all areas. Using statistical methods different flux populations were distinguished (i.e. background soil gases and deeply derived gases) and the total gas emissions from study sites calculated. The results of this work show that CH4/CO2 ratios of deep fluids, fumarolic fluids in the case of the volcanic-geothermal environment and biogas in landfills, are roughly maintained in the gas phase diffusely degassed by the soil. Due to high spatial variability, a large number of flux measurements and appropriate statistical methods are needed to estimate total gas discharge from study areas. Furthermore, the simultaneous measurement of diffuse CH4 and CO2 fluxes represents a strong constraint for interpretative models of deep processes associated with soil degassing. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Injection started in October 1996, to date nearly 8 million tonnes of CO2 have been injected without any significant operational problems observed in the capture plant or in the injection well. The Sleipner project is the first commercial application of CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers in the world. To monitor the injected CO2, a separate project called the saline aquifer CO2 storage (SACS) project was established in 1998. As part of the SACS project, 3D seismic surveying has been used to successfully monitor the CO2 in the Utsira formation, an industry first. Repeat seismic surveys have successfully imaged movement of the injected CO2 within the reservoir. Reservoir simulation tools have been successfully adapted to describe the migration of the CO2 in the reservoir. The simulation packages have been calibrated against the repeat seismic surveys and shown themselves to be capable of replicating the position of the CO2 in the reservoir. The possible reactions between minerals within the reservoir sand and the injected CO2 have been studied by laboratory experiments and simulations. The cumulative experiences of the Sleipner and SACS projects will be embodied in a Best Practice Manual to assist other organisations planning CO2 injection projects to take advantage of the learning processes undertaken and to assist in facilitating new projects of this type. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

This new technique has radically changed the energy future of the United States. The U.S. has shifted from a waning producer of natural gas to a growing producer. The Energy Information Administration forecasts that by 2035 nearly half of U.S. natural gas will come from shale gas. Texas is a major player in these developments. Of the eight states and coastal areas that account for the bulk of U.S. gas, Texas has the largest proved reserves. Texas' Barnett Shale already produces six percent of the continental U.S.' gas and exploration of Texas' other shale gas regions is just beginning. Shale gas production is highly controversial, in part because of environmental concerns. Some U.S. states have put hydraulic fracturing moratoriums in place because of fear of drinking water contamination. The federal government has gotten involved and some states, like Texas, have accused it of overreaching. The contention over shale gas drilling in the U.S. may be a bellwether for other parts of the world that are now moving forward with their own shale gas production. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

When indoor radon measurements are grouped by geology and 1-km squares of the national grid, the cumulative percentage of the variation between and within mapped geological units is shown to be 34-40{\%}.

abstract = {Passive radon radiometers, based on alpha particle etched track detectors, are very attractive for the assessment of radon exposure. The present review considers various devices used for measurement of the volume activity of radon isotopes and their daughters and determination of equilibrium coefficients. Such devices can be classified into 8 groups: (i) open or `bare' detectors, (ii) open chambers, (iii) 222Rn chambers with an inlet filter, (iv) advanced 222Rn radiometers, (v) multipurpose radiometers, (vi) radiometers based on a combination of etched track detectors and an electrostatic field, (vii) radiometers based on etched track detectors and activated charcoal and (viii) devices for the measurement of radon isotopes and or radon daughters by means of track parameter measurements. Some of them such as the open detector and the chamber with an inlet filter have a variety of modifications and are applied widely both in geophysical research and radon dosimetric surveys. At the same time, some of the radiometers are still in the development phase. CR-39 has become the stage-of-the-art etched track detector for environmental radon. However, due to their ability to work in the open mode, cheapness, possibility of utilization of spark track counters and/or smaller measurement error, other types of alpha particle sensitive detectors such as cellulose nitrate (LR 115) or polycarbonate (Makrofol E) are often used for radon measurements in the environment. In the last decade a number of papers devoted to development of multipurpose radiometers, theoretical models which enable calculation of the dosimeter response and investigation of the permeability of various filters to radon, have been published and are reviewed.},

abstract = {This manuscript presents a simple yet effective method to account for uncertainty in hydrologic ensemble forecasting applications. Most operational hydrological ensemble forecasting systems only account for uncertainty in future climate (e.g. precipitation) forcings, ignoring other sources of uncertainty (e.g. model error). The result can be under-dispersive and overconfident forecasts. Ensemble dressing is a form of statistical post-processing to include information about the uncertainty of individual ensemble members. First, the historical simulations can be corrected to remove systematic biases. Next, the simulated and observed flow data are transformed to ensure that model residuals can be fitted to a distribution (e.g. normal); this study uses a 2-parameter log-sinh transformation. Model residuals in transformed space determine the width of the error distribution. Ensemble forecasts are then generated and transformed. Each ensemble is dressed with the error distribution, the results are untransformed, and finally, a probabilistic forecast is derived from the collective distribution of the dressed ensembles. The method is applied to 128 catchments in southeast Australia, demonstrating that the raw ensemble can be made reliable through the use of this dressing method.

abstract = {In this paper the $\alpha$-recoil emanation theory is presented as a major mechanism for Rn release from solid materials. The basic theory is developed for Rn emanation from geometrical shapes: spheres and cylinders having variable thickness of precursor-Ra containing material. Subsequently, a sphere-pore model of emanation from mineral grains (like those in rocks, soils, etc.) is developed. In this model a surface of the grain is constructed as a superposition of in- and out-directed spherical caps and cylindrical pores. The model incorporates processes like Rn embedding, pore overlap, water effect and emanation from the edges. Using such a geometrical model it is shown how the Rn emanating-power measurements can give a clue to the Ra distribution and surface properties of the samples. In particular, it is shown that for grains reasonably larger than the recoil range and for surface Ra distribution, the emanating power is independent of the grain size but the total Ra concentration varies with the reciprocal of the grain size. The opposite is true for Ra distributed uniformly throughout the volume of the grain. It is shown how the Rn emanating power is related to the surface porosity of the grain. Also, implications are made with respect to U transport in nature, and with respect to low emanating power from lunar soil. Finally, a failure of the emanation theory is discussed to reproduce emanation curves for the samples having high specific surface areas and Ra distributed throughout the volume. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {A baseline determination of CO2 and CH4 fluxes and soil-gas con- centrations of CO2 and CH4 was made over the Teapot Dome oil field in theNaval PetroleumReserve3 inNatronaCounty,Wyoming, United States. This was done in anticipation of the experimenta- tion with CO2 sequestration in the Pennsylvanian Tensleep Sand- stone underlying the field at a depth of 5500 ft (1680 m). The mea- surements were made in January 2004 to capture the system with minimum biological activity in the soils, resulting in a minimum CO2 flux and a maximumCH4 flux. TheCO2 fluxeswere measured in the field with an infrared spectroscopicmethod. The CH4 fluxes were determined from gas-chromatographic measurements on dis- crete samples from under the flux chambers. The CO2 and CH4 were determined at 30-, 60-, and 100-cm (11-, 23-, and 39-in.) depths in soil gas by gas chromatography. A total of 40 locations had trip- licate fluxmeasurements using 1.00-m2 (10.763-ft2) chambers, and soil gas was sampled at single points at each of the 40 locations. Carbon dioxide fluxes averaged 227.1 mg CO2 m2 day1,a standard deviation of 186.9mgm2 day1, and a range of 281.7 to 732.9mgm2 day1, not including one location with subsurface infrastructure contamination. Methane fluxes averaged 0.137 mg CH4m2 day1, standard deviation of 0.326 mgm2 day1, and a range of 0.481 to 1.14 mg m2 day1, not including the same contaminated location. Soil-gas CO2 concentrations increased with depth, averaging 618, 645, and 1010 ppmv at 30, 60, and 100 cm (11, 23, and 39 in.), respectively. Soil-gas CH4 concentrations averaged 0.128, 0.114, and 0.093 ppmv at 30, 60, and 100 cm (11, 23, and 39 in.), respectively. The decrease inCH4 with depth reflects a slow rate of methanotrophic oxidation, even during winter conditions. The d13C of the soil gas CO2 was also determined in the soil- gas samples and in the atmosphere. These data dem- onstrated that the increased CO2 with depth was derived from the biological oxidation of soil organic matter.},

abstract = {Aquaculture is viewed as a potential mechanism to meet the growing demand for seafood around the world. The future of bivalve shellfish aquaculture in the U.S. hinges on sustainable practices on the part of industry and a more consistent regulatory regime. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture is a recent practice relative to its history in other countries, beginning in the late 1800s along the U.S. West Coast where it is now well established with farm raised product utilizing land-based hatcheries and grow-out directly in numerous estuaries. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture can be viewed as a disturbance which modifies the estuarine system in three ways: 1) changes in material processes - bivalves process food and produce wastes; 2) addition of physical structure - aquaculture introduces the cultured organisms and in some cases a physical anchoring structure; and 3) pulse disturbances like harvest and bed maintenance disturb sediments, remove species in addition to the cultured organisms themselves, and change resource or habitat availability. In U.S. West Coast estuaries, water column and sediment nutrient concentrations are relatively high and influenced by large tidal exchange and proximity to deeper nearshore ocean waters where upwelling controls production during summer months. Bivalves are unlikely to influence material processes except at local bed scales in these systems, although estuary-wide effects could appear as the fraction of cultured area rises or in poorly flushed bays. Bivalve culture clearly modifies estuarine habitat at local community and at landscape scales and effects are most often evaluated against existing structured habitat in the form of submerged aquatic vegetation. Individual activities act as pulse disturbances and the recovery of eelgrass (Zostera marina) to pre-disturbance levels is variable ({\textless} 2 to {\textgreater} 5 years). The extent of disturbance depends on the aquaculture practice and the distribution of eelgrass reflects a balance of space competition, pulse disturbance and recovery, and is therefore at dynamic equilibrium on aquaculture beds. Structure provided by aquaculture appears functionally similar to eelgrass for small benthic infauna and mobile epibenthic fauna while use of aquaculture as habitat by larger more mobile invertebrates and fish depends on mobility and varies with life-history stage and taxon being evaluated. Scale seems a very important management consideration and further research at estuarine landscape scales, especially for habitat use by important invertebrates and fish, may prove useful in designing and implementing best management practices. Though local and short term effects from aquaculture are clearly evident in U.S. West Coast estuaries, bivalve aquaculture does not remove area from the estuary or degrade water quality like other anthropogenic influences, and thus has not been implicated in shifts to alternate states or reduced adaptive capacity of the larger ecological system.},

abstract = {Soil-gas radon measurements provide a valuable tool in assessing probable indoor radon levels on a regional basis. However, in Great Britain, seasonal weather changes can cause large changes in soil-gas radon concentration. Although this does not significantly constrain systematic radon potential mapping programmes, it does cause difficulties in responding to ad-hoc requests for site-specific radon investigations. The relationship between soil-gas radon and gamma spectrometry measurements made in the field with radon released from a representative sample of soil in the laboratory has been investigated as part of a program to develop a method of radon potential mapping and site investigation which can be used at any time of the year. Multiple soil and soil-gas samples were collected from sites underlain by bedrocks with widely varying radon potentials. For each geological unit, sites both free of and covered by glacial drift deposits were sampled. Soil and soil-gas samples were taken at the same depth of 60–100 cm. The effectiveness of these radon site investigation procedures has been evaluated by studying the relationship between the soil-gas radon, gamma spectrometry and radon emanation data with an independent estimate of the radon risk. The geologic radon potential (GEORP), which is the proportion of existing dwellings which exceed the UK radon Action Level (200 Bq m−3) for a particular combination of solid and drift geology within a defined geographic area, has been used for this study as the independent estimate of radon risk. Soil-gas radon, radon emanation and eU (equivalent uranium by field $\gamma$ spectrometry) are all good geochemical indicators of radon risk (GEORP) in Derbyshire but only soil-gas radon correlates significantly with GEORP in Northamptonshire. Radon in soil gas discriminates more effectively between sites with different radon potential in Northamptonshire if soil permeability is also taken into account. In general, measurement of soil-gas radon in the field provides the most universally applicable indicator of radon potential. If soil-gas radon concentrations cannot be determined because of climatic factors, for example when the soil profile is waterlogged, measurement of radon emanation in the laboratory or measurement of eU can be used as radon potential indicators in some geological environments. This applies particularly in areas where the soil composition rather than the composition and permeability of the underlying rock or superficial deposits are the dominant controls of radon potential. It appears, therefore, that it may be necessary to use different radon site investigation methods according to the specific factors controlling radon emanation from the ground. In some cases no method will provide a reliable indicator of radon risk under unfavourable climatic conditions.},

Three alpha spectroscopy monitors were used to measure radon in soil air in a 25,000-m 2 area, following a regular sampling design with a 20-m 2 grid. Repeatability and reproducibility of the results were assessed by means of duplicate measurements in six sampling positions. Furthermore, three points not affected by oil spills were sampled to estimate radon background concentration in soil air. Data histograms, Q-Q plots, variograms, and cluster analysis allowed to recognize two data populations, associated with the possible path of a fault and a lithological discontinuity. Even though the concentration of radon in soil air was dominated by this discontinuity, the characterization of the background emanation in each lithological unit allowed to distinguish areas potentially affected by NAPL, thus justifying the application of radon emanometry as a screening technique for the delineation of NAPL plumes in sites with lithological discontinuities.},

abstract = {Methane (CH4) in terrestrial environments, whether microbial, thermogenic, or abiogenic, exhibits a large variance in C and H stable isotope ratios due to primary processes of formation. Isotopic variability can be broadened through secondary, post-genetic processes, such as mixing and isotopic fractionation by oxidation. The highest and lowest 13C and 2H (or D, deuterium) concentrations in CH4 found in various geologic environments to date, are defined as "natural" terrestrial extremes. We have discovered a new extreme in a natural gas seep with values of deuterium concentrations, ??DCH4, up to +124??? that far exceed those reported for any terrestrial gas. The gas, seeping from the small Homorod mud volcano in Transylvania (Romania), also has extremely high concentrations of nitrogen ({\textgreater}92 vol.{\%}) and helium (up to 1.4 vol.{\%}). Carbon isotopes in CH4, C2H6 and CO2, and nitrogen isotopes in N2 indicate a primary organic sedimentary origin for the gas (a minor mantle component is suggested by the 3He/4He ratio, R/Ra{\~{}}0.39). Both thermogenic gas formation modeling and Rayleigh fractionation modeling suggest that the extreme deuterium enrichment could be explained by an oxidation process characterised by a ??DCH4 and ??13CCH4 enrichment ratio (??H/??C) of about 20, and may be accounted for by abiogenic oxidation mediated by metal oxides. All favourable conditions for such a process exist in the Homorod area, where increased heat flow during Pliocene-Quaternary volcanism may have played a key role. Finally we observed rapid variations (within 1h) in C and H isotope ratios of CH4, and in the H2S concentrations which are likely caused by mixing of the deep oxidized CH4-N2-H2S-He rich gas with a microbial methane generated in the mud pool of one of the seeps.We hypothesize that the unusual features of Homorod gas can be the result of a rare combination of factors induced by the proximity of sedimentary organic matter, mafic, metal-rich volcanic rocks and salt diapirs, leading to the following processes: a) primary thermogenic generation of gas at temperatures between 130 and 175??C; b) secondary alteration through abiogenic oxidation, likely triggered by the Neogene-Quaternary volcanism of the eastern Transylvanian margin; and c) mixing at the surface with microbial methane that formed through fermentation in the mud volcano water pool. The Homorod gas seep is a rare example that demonstrates how post-genetic processes can produce extreme gas isotope signatures (thus far only theorized), and that extremely positive ??DCH4 values cannot be used to unambiguously distinguish between biotic and abiotic origin. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil salinization is one of the most important causes for land degradation and desertification and is an important threat to land management, farming activities, water quality, and sustainable development in arid and semi-arid areas. Soil salinization is often characterized with significant spatiotemporal dynamics. The salt-affected soil is predominant in the Ebinur Lake region in the Northwestern China. However, detailed local soil salinity information is ambiguous at the best due to limited monitoring techniques. Nowadays, the availability of Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2, offers unprecedented perspectives for the monitoring and mapping of soil salinity. The use of MSI data is an innovative attempt for salinity detection in arid land. We hypothesize that field observations and MSI data and MSI data-derived spectral indices using the partial least square regression (PLSR) approach will yield fairly accurate regional salinity map. Based on electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil:water extract (EC) of 72 ground-truth measurements (out of 116 sample sites) and various spectral parameters, such as satellite band reflectance, published satellite salinity indices, red-edge indices, newly constructed two-band indices, and three-band indices from MSI data, we built a few inversion models in an attempt to produce the regional salinity maps. Different algorithms including Pearson correlation coefficient method (PCC), variable importance in projection (VIP), Gray relational analysis (GRA), and random forest (RF) were applied for variable selection. The results suggest that both the newly proposed normalized difference index (NDI) [(B12 − B7) / (B12 + B7)] and three-band index (TBI4) [(B12 − B3) / (B3 − B11)] show a better correlation with validation data and could be applied to estimate the soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region. The established models were validated using the remaining 44 independent ground-based measurements. The RF-PLSR model performed the best across the five models with R2V, RMSEV, and RPD of 0.92, 7.58 dS m−1, and 2.36, respectively. The result from this model was then used to map the soil salinity over the study area. Our analyses suggest that soil salinization changes quite significantly in different seasons. Specifically, soil salinity in the dry season was higher than in the wet season, mostly in the lake area and nearby shores. We contend that the results from the study will be useful for soil salinization monitoring and land reclamation in arid or semi-arid regions outside the current study area.},

abstract = {Publicly available information about radon potential in Northern Ireland is currently based on indoor radon results averaged over 1-km grid squares, an approach that does not take into account the geological origin of the radon. This study describes a spatially more accurate estimate of the radon potential of Northern Ireland using an integrated radon potential mapping method based on indoor radon measurements and geology that was originally developed for mapping radon potential in England and Wales. A refinement of this method was also investigated using linear regression analysis of a selection of relevant airborne and soil geochemical parameters from the Tellus Project. The most significant independent variables were found to be eU, a parameter derived from airborne gamma spectrometry measurements of radon decay products in the top layer of soil and exposed bedrock, and the permeability of the ground. The radon potential map generated from the Tellus data agrees in many respects with the map based on indoor radon data and geology but there are several areas where radon potential predicted from the airborne radiometric and permeability data is substantially lower. This under-prediction could be caused by the radon concentration being lower in the top 30 cm of the soil than at greater depth, because of the loss of radon from the surface rocks and soils to air.},

abstract = {Investigations of occupational and environmental risk caused by the use of agrochemicals have received considerable interest over the last decades. And yet, in developing countries, the lack of staff and analytical equipment as well the costs of chemical analyses make it difficult, if not impossible, to monitor pesticide contamination and residues in humans, air, water, and soils. A new and simple method is presented here for estimation of pesticide deposition in humans and soil after application. The estimate is derived on the basis of water mass balance measured in a given number of high absorbent papers under low evaporative conditions and unsaturated atmosphere. The method is presented as a suitable, rapid, low cost screening tool, complementary to toxicological tests, to assess occupational and environmental exposure caused by knapsack sprayers, where there is a lack of analytical instruments. This new method, called the " weight method", was tested to obtain drift deposition on the neighbouring field and the clothes of the applicator after spraying water with a knapsack sprayer in one of the largest areas of potato production in Colombia. The results were confirmed by experimental data using a tracer and the same set up used for the weight method. The weight method was able to explain 86{\%} of the airborne drift and deposition variance. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) has been identified as a key technology for mitigating carbon emissions. However, CCS is still very much at a developmental stage and the full-scale projects required to test the technology have proven difficult to implement, with lack of societal acceptance considered a key contributing factor to this delay. This paper reports on a study that explored practices for effective communication, engagement strategies and activities in the context of five detailed CCS project case studies. The cases studied included Barendrecht, The Netherlands; Carson, USA; FutureGen, USA; ZeroGen, Australia; and the CO2CRC Otway project, Australia. Comparative analysis of these cases identified a series of factors including: the extent to which key government and project team members are aligned; deployment of communications experts as part of the project team from the outset; consideration of the social context; the degree of flexibility in the project; and competition involving community self-selection. The research team designated these " critical success factors" that, when present, seemed to enhance the effectiveness of best practices in engagement and contribute to successful project deployment in some cases. The paper proposes that project developers need to consider ways to maximise these critical factors as part of their project planning and implementation process. It also discusses best practices in stakeholder communication and engagement activities applicable to CCS projects. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the scientific evidence published since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) on observed and projected impacts of anthropogenic climate change in Europe and adaptation responses. The geographical scope of this chapter is the same as in AR4 with the inclusion of Turkey. Thus, the European region includes all countries from Iceland in the west to the Russian Federation (west of the Urals) and the Caspian Sea in the east, and from the northern shores of the Mediterranean and Black Seas and the Caucasus in the south to the Arctic Ocean in the north. Impacts above the Arctic Circle are addressed in Chapter 28 and impacts in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas in Chapter 30. Impacts in Malta, Cyprus, and other island states in Europe are discussed in Chapter 29. The European region has been divided into five sub-regions (see Figure 23-1): Atlantic, Alpine, Southern, Northern, and Continental. The sub-regions are derived by aggregating the climate zones developed by Metzger et al. (2005) and therefore represent geographical and ecological zones rather than political boundaries. The scientific evidence has been evaluated to compare impacts across (rather than within) sub-regions, although this was not always possible depending on the scientific information available. 23.1.1. Scope and Route Map of Chapter, The chapter is structured around key policy areas. Sections 23.3 to 23.6 summarize the latest scientific evidence on sensitivity climate, observed impacts and attribution, projected impacts, and adaptation options, with respect to four main categories of impacts: • Production systems and physical infrastructure • Agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and bioenergy production • Health protection and social welfare • Protection of environmental quality and biological conservation The benefit of assessing evidence in a regional chapter is that impacts across sectors can be described, and interactions between impacts can be identified. Further, the cross-sectoral decision making required to address climate change can be reviewed. The chapter also includes sections that were not in AR4.},

abstract = {Climate change can increase the risk of conditions that exceed human thermoregulatory capacity. Although numerous studies report increased mortality associated with extreme heat events, quantifying the global risk of heat-related mortality remains challenging due to a lack of comparable data on heat-related deaths. Here we conducted a global analysis of documented lethal heat events to identify the climatic conditions associated with human death and then quantified the current and projected occurrence of such deadly climatic conditions worldwide. We reviewed papers published between 1980 and 2014, and found 783 cases of excess human mortality associated with heat from 164 cities in 36 countries. Based on the climatic conditions of those lethal heat events, we identified a global threshold beyond which daily mean surface air temperature and relative humidity become deadly. Around 30{\%} of the world's population is currently exposed to climatic conditions exceeding this deadly threshold for at least 20 days a year. By 2100, this percentage is projected to increase to -1/448{\%} under a scenario with drastic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and -1/474{\%} under a scenario of growing emissions. An increasing threat to human life from excess heat now seems almost inevitable, but will be greatly aggravated if greenhouse gases are not considerably reduced.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

Hydrodynamics and morphology in combination with freshwater inflow control the freshwater flushing time, and the timescale for biogeochemical processes to operate that include microbial activity, particle-dissolved phase interactions, and benthic exchanges. In some systems atmospheric inputs and exchanges with coastal waters can also be important. Climate change will affect nutrient inputs and behaviour through modifications to temperature, wind patterns, the hydrological cycle, and sea level rise. Resulting impacts include: 1) inundation of freshwater systems 2) changes in stratification, flushing times and phytoplankton productivity 3) increased coastal storm activity 4) changes in species and ecosystem function. A combination of continuing high inputs of nutrients through human activity and climate change is anticipated to lead to enhanced eutrophication in the future. The most obvious impacts of increasing global temperature will be in sub-arctic systems where permafrost zones will be reduced in combination with enhanced inputs from glacial systems.Improved process understanding in several key areas including cycling of organic N and P, benthic exchanges, resuspension, impact of bio-irrigation, particle interactions, submarine groundwater discharges, and rates and magnitude of bacterially-driven recycling processes, is needed. Development of high frequency in situ nutrient analysis systems will provide data to improve predictive models that need to incorporate a wider variety of key factors, although the complexity of estuarine systems makes such modelling a challenge. However, overall a more holistic approach is needed to effectively understand, predict and manage the impact of macronutrients on estuaries. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The largest accumulations on Earth of natural gas are in the form of gas hydrate, found mainly offshore in outer continental margin sediment and, to a lesser extent, in polar regions commonly associated with permafrost. Measurements of hydrocarbon gas compositions and of carbon-isotopic compositions of methane from natural gas hydrate samples, collected in subaquatic settings from around the world, suggest that methane guest molecules in the water clathrate structures are mainly derived by the microbial reduction of CO2 from sedimentary organic matter. Typically, these hydrocarbon gases are composed of {\textgreater} 99{\%} methane, with carbon-isotopic compositions (??13CPDB) ranging from - 57 to - 73???. In only two regions, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caspian Sea, has mainly thermogenic methane been found in gas hydrate. There, hydrocarbon gases have methane contents ranging from 21 to 97{\%}, with ??13C values ranging from - 29 to - 57???. At a few locations, where the gas hydrate contains a mixture of microbial and thermal methane, microbial methane is always dominant. Continental gas hydrate, identified in Alaska and Russia, also has hydrocarbon gases composed of {\textgreater} 99{\%} methane, with carbon-isotopic compositions ranging from - 41 to - 49???. These gas hydrate deposits also contain a mixture of microbial and thermal methane, with thermal methane likely to be dominant. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. ?? 1996.},

abstract = {Predictive mapping of indoor radon potential often requires the use of additional datasets. A range of geological, geochemical and geophysical data may be considered, either individually or in combination. The present work is an evaluation of how much of the indoor radon variation in south west England can be explained by four different datasets: a) the geology (G), b) the airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy (AGR), c) the geochemistry of topsoil (TSG) and d) the geochemistry of stream sediments (SSG). The study area was chosen since it provides a large (197,464) indoor radon dataset in association with the above information. Geology provides information on the distribution of the materials that may contribute to radon release while the latter three items provide more direct observations on the distributions of the radionuclide elements uranium (U), thorium (Th) and potassium (K). In addition, (c) and (d) provide multi-element assessments of geochemistry which are also included in this study. The effectiveness of datasets for predicting the existing indoor radon data is assessed through the level (the higher the better) of explained variation ({\%} of variance or ANOVA) obtained from the tested models. A multiple linear regression using a compositional data (CODA) approach is carried out to obtain the required measure of determination for each analysis. Results show that, amongst the four tested datasets, the soil geochemistry (TSG, i.e. including all the available 41 elements, 10 major - Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Si, Ti - plus 31 trace) provides the highest explained variation of indoor radon (about 40{\%}); more than double the value provided by U alone (ca. 15{\%}), or the sub composition U, Th, K (ca. 16{\%}) from the same TSG data. The remaining three datasets provide values ranging from about 27{\%} to 32.5{\%}. The enhanced prediction of the AGR model relative to the U, Th, K in soils suggests that the AGR signal captures more than just the U, Th and K content in the soil. The best result is obtained by including the soil geochemistry with geology and AGR (TSG + G + AGR, ca. 47{\%}). However, adding G and AGR to the TSG model only slightly improves the prediction (ca. +7{\%}), suggesting that the geochemistry of soils already contain most of the information given by geology and airborne datasets together, at least with regard to the explanation of indoor radon. From the present analysis performed in the SW of England, it may be concluded that each one of the four datasets is likely to be useful for radon mapping purposes, whether alone or in combination with others. The present work also suggest that the complete soil geochemistry dataset (TSG) is more effective for indoor radon modelling than using just the U (+Th, K) concentration in soil.},

abstract = {In healthy buildings, it is considered essential to quantify air quality. One of the most fashionable indicators is radon gas. To determine the presence of this element, which is harmful to health, in the environment, the composition of the soil is studied. The presence of radon gas within a building depends both on the terrain in which it is located and on the composition of the materials of which it is composed, and not as was previously believed, only by the composition of the soil (whether granitic or not). Many countries are currently studying this phenomenon, including Spain where the building regulations regarding the accumulation of radon gas, do not list in their technical codes, the maximum dose that can a building can hold so that it is not harmful to people and the measures to correct excessive accumulation. Therefore, once the possible existence of radon in any underground building has been verified, regardless of the characteristics of the soil, the importance of defining and unifying the regulations on different levels of radon in all architectural constructions is evident. Medical and health science agencies, including the World Health Organization, consider that radon gas is a very harmful element for people. This element, in its gaseous state, is radioactive and it is present in almost soils in which buildings are implanted. Granitic type soils present higher levels of radon gas. Non-granitic soils have traditionally been considered to have very low radon levels. However, this paper demonstrates the relevant presence of radon in non-granitic soils, specifically in clayey soils, by providing the results of research carried out in the underground air raid shelter at Balmis Square in Alicante (Spain). The results of the measurements of radon accumulation in the Plaza Balmis shelter are five times higher than those obtained in a similar ungrounded building. This research addresses the constructive typology of an under-ground building and the radon presence in its interior obtained using rigorous measurement techniques.},

abstract = {Global land cover (LC) mapping has been the main source of monitoring our global landscapes for a wide range of applications e.g., food production estimation, urbanization, deforestation, climate change studies, air/soil/water pollution, and CO 2 emission. Several initiatives and organizations have attempted to generate global LC maps using remote sensing data and in-situ data. Noteworthy examples include IGBP-DISCover, GlobeCover 2009, FAO, GLC 2000, MODIS, GlobeLand30. While researchers including climate change scientists require fine LC maps in terms of spatial resolution and temporal coverage for continuous monitoring of the planet, these datasets lack of fulfilling this goal. Understanding the trend of LC changes as well as the direction of future changes at global level is of vital importance to a broad spectrum of stakeholders, and essential for addressing the sustainable development goals worldwide. European Space Agency has recently released its climate change initiative's LC dataset called CCI-LC, which aims at achieving this ambition with 300 m spatial resolution and 24-year continuous temporal coverage within 1992–2015. The main objective of this study is to quantify the global land changes within this timeframe and also to predict the future land change by 2050 in order to gain a global picture of our future planet. This is a timely objective since more than ever scientists, environmentalist, and governors require to know how our future will look like and how they can achieve the goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) i.e., the Paris Agreement. The achieved results reveal massive land changes of different kinds e.g., deforestation, urbanization, desertification, forestry, water and ice shrinkage across different continents. The employed predictive modelling for year 2030 and 2050 messages dramatic changes among different LC types. Our discussions and conclusive comments can guide policy-makers, environmental planners, ecosystem services providers and climate change researchers to gain finer insights about our planet by 2050. Future research direction draws attention for investigating the underlying causes and consequences on our ecosystems and human population.},

abstract = {Warming of the Earth climate system is unequivocal. That climate changes affect the stability of natural and engineered slopes and have consequences on landslides, is also undisputable. Less clear is the type, extent, magnitude and direction of the changes in the stability conditions, and on the location, abundance, activity and frequency of landslides in response to the projected climate changes. Climate and landslides act at only partially overlapping spatial and temporal scales, complicating the evaluation of the climate impacts on landslides. We review the literature on landslide-climate studies, and find a bias in their geographical distribution, with large parts of the world not investigated. We recommend to fill the gap with new studies in Asia, South America, and Africa. We examine advantages and limits of the approaches adopted to evaluate the effects of climate variations on landslides, including prospective modelling and retrospective methods that use landslide and climate records. We consider changes in temperature, precipitation, wind and weather systems, and their direct and indirect effects on the stability of single slopes, and we use a probabilistic landslide hazard model to appraise regional landslide changes. Our review indicates that the modelling results of landslide-climate studies depend more on the emission scenarios, the Global Circulation Models, and the methods to downscale the climate variables, than on the description of the variables controlling slope processes. We advocate for constructing ensembles of projections based on a range of emissions scenarios, and to use carefully results from worst-case scenarios that may over/under-estimate landslide hazards and risk. We further advocate that uncertainties in the landslide projections must be quantified and communicated to decision makers and the public. We perform a preliminary global assessment of the future landslide impact, and we present a global map of the projected impact of climate change on landslide activity and abundance. Where global warming is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe rainfall events, a primary trigger of rapid-moving landslides that cause many landslide fatalities, we predict an increase in the number of people exposed to landslide risk. Finally, we give recommendations for landslide adaptation and risk reduction strategies in the framework of a warming climate.},

abstract = {Due to its negative impacts on land productivity and plant growth, soil salinization is a significant problem particularly in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Among the natural factors of soil salinization, parent materials including high amount of salts and minerals in soil structure, known as primary salinization, can be addressed. Conventional irrigation techniques and poor drainage systems are predominant human-induced activities that result in secondary salinization. Countries with especially dryland environment, face difficulty in providing adequate food for their rapidly increasing population since each year lots of cultivated land are abandoned due to adverse effects of primary and secondary soil salinization. Therefore, monitoring, mapping and predicting soil salinization is of utmost importance regarding lessening and/or preventing further increase in soil salinity through some protective measures. The subject of concern becomes even more pronounced particularly in agricultural lands as is the case in the vicinity of Tuz (Salt) Lake Region in Turkey. This research focuses mainly on multi-temporal monitoring of Tuz Lake Region in order to track changes in areas of salty spots in years 1990, 2002, 2006, 2011 and 2015. A total number of 25 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 images obtained between 1990 and 2015 were analysed in this study. Field electrical conductivity (EC) measurements for 322 soil samples in year 2002 were checked; and 28 of these samples were selected for generating salinity maps representing areas in the vicinity of the lake. All satellite images were radiometrically and atmospherically corrected prior to classification. Following the pre-processing step, five soil salinity indices were applied on all satellite images. 28 soil samples were then overlaid on images in order to extract the exact index values related to soil samples and regression approach was used to relate satellite image-derived salinity indices and field measurements. Linear and exponential regression analyses were conducted separately as the next step for all indices based on data gathered in 2002. Salinity index (SI) 1 = B1*B3 showed the best result with R2 value of 0.93 and 0.83 for exponential and linear regression analysis, respectively. Salinity maps for years 1990, 2006, 2011 and 2015 were further produced utilizing the exponential and linear regression expressions attained for year 2002. Besides, this study detected land cover changes in the area from year 2000–2006, and from 2006 to 2012 by using CORINE land cover data to analyse the possible relationships between land cover change and salinity changes.},

Laboratory for radioactivity and dose measurement, Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad has rich databases of natural radionuclides concentrations in Vojvodina soil and also of indoor radon concentrations for the region of Vojvodina, Northern Province of Serbia. In this paper we present the results of correlative and multivariate analysis of these results and soil characteristics in order to estimate the geogenic radon potential. The correlative and multivariate analysis were done using Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis software package TMVA package, within ROOT analysis framework, which uses several comparable multivariate methods for our analysis. The evaluation ranking results based on the best signal efficiency and purity, show that the Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) and Multi Layer Preceptor (MLP), based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are multivariate methods which give the best results in the analysis. The BDTG multivariate method shows that variables with the highest importance are radio-nuclides activity on 30 cm depth. Moreover, the multivariate regression methods give a good approximation of indoor radon activity using full set of input variables. On several locations in the city of Novi Sad the results of indoor radon concentrations, radon emanation from soil, gamma spectrometry measurements of underlying soil and geology characteristics of soil were analyzed in detail in order to verify previously obtained correlations for Vojvodina soil.},

abstract = {Barium, lanthanum, ytterbium, and yttrium partitioning experiments between fluid-saturated haplogranitic melts and aqueous solutions were conducted at 750 to 950 °C and 0.2 to 1. GPa to investigate the effects of melt and fluid composition, pressure, and temperature. Partition coefficients were determined using different experimental methods. On one hand quenched experiments were performed, and on the other hand, trace element contents in the aqueous fluid were determined directly using a hydrothermal diamond-anvil cell and synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence microanalysis of K-lines. The latter required a high excitation energy of 50. keV due to the high energies necessary to excite the K-lines of the studied elements. The data from these two techniques showed good agreement for chloridic solutions, whereas quenching had a significant effect on results of the experiments with only water in the case of Ba. In Cl-free experiments, lanthanum and yttrium, trace element contents were even below detection limit in the quenched fluids, whereas small concentrations were detected in comparable in-situ experiments. This distinct difference is likely due to back reactions between fluid and melt upon cooling. The partitioning data of all elements show no dependence on the temperature and only small dependence on pressure. In contrast, the partitioning is strongly influenced by the composition of the starting fluid and melt. For chloridic fluids, there was a sharp increase in the Ba, La, Y and Yb partition coefficients with the alumina saturation index (ASI). The Ba partition coefficient increased from 0.002 at an ASI of 0.8 to 0.55 at an ASI of 1.07. At higher ASI, it decreased slightly to 0.2 at an ASI of {\~{}}1.3. Likewise, it was one to two orders of magnitude higher in chloridic fluids compared to those found in H2O experiments. Fluid-melt partition coefficients of La and Y increased from 0.002 at an ASI of {\~{}}0.8 to {\~{}}0.1 at an ASI of 1.2. In the same ASI range, the Yb partition coefficient increased to a maximum value of 0.02. Even at high salinities all elements fractionate into the melt. The compositional dependence of the partitioning data imply that both melt composition and fluid composition have a strong influence on trace element behavior and that complexation of Ba, REE and Y tin the fluid is not only controlled by the presence of Cl- in the fluid. Instead, interaction of these elements with major melt components dissolved in the fluid is very likely. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For at least half a century, and building on observations first made a century earlier, the gravity model has been the most commonly-used paradigm for understanding gross migration flows between regions. This model owes its success to, firstly, its intuitive consistency with migration theories; secondly, ease of estimation in its simplest form; and, thirdly, goodness of fit in most applications. While fitting gravity models of aggregate migration flows started taking backstage to microdata analysis in the 1980s, a recent comeback has resulted from increasing applications to international migration and from the emergence of statistical theories appropriate for studying spatial interaction. In this paper we review the status quo and argue for greater integration of internal and international migration modelling. Additionally we revisit the issues of parameter stability and distance deterrence measurement by means of a New Zealand case study. We argue that gravity modelling of migration has a promising future in a multi-regional stochastic population projection system —an area in which the model has been to date surprisingly underutilised. We conclude with outlining current challenges and opportunities in this field.},

abstract = {Soil salinization is one of the most common land degradation processes, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, where precipitation exceeds evaporation. Under such climatic conditions, soluble salts are accumulated in the soil, influencing soil properties with ultimate decline in productivity. An integrated approach using remote sensing in addition to various statistical methods has shown success for developing soil salinity prediction models. The present study presents a model to map soil salinity using remote sensing and geographic information systems. Different spectral indices were calculated from original bands of landsat images. Statistical correlation between field measurements of electrical conductivity (ECe) and remote sensing spectral indices showed that salinity index (SI) had the highest correlation with ECe. Combining these remotely sensed and ECe variables into one model yielded the best fit with R2 = 0.78. The result obtained from SI was not only area-wise, but also with its intensity. Out of the total area, 18.8{\%} and 23{\%} were identified as moderately and slightly saline, respectively. This shows that remote sensing data can be effectively used to model and map spatial variations of soil salinity in irrigation areas.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The inhalation of radon, a well-established human carcinogen, is the principal-and omnipresent-source of radioactivity exposure for the general population of most countries. Scientists have thus sought to assess the lung cancer risk associated with indoor radon. Our aim here is to assess this risk in France, using all available epidemiologic results and performing an uncertainty analysis. METHODS We examined the exposure-response relations derived from cohorts of miners and from joint analyses of residential case-control studies and considered the interaction between radon and tobacco. The exposure data come from measurement campaigns conducted since the beginning of the 1980s by the Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety and the Directorate-General of Health in France. We quantified the uncertainties associated with risk coefficients and exposures and calculated their impact on risk estimates. RESULTS The estimated number of lung cancer deaths attributable to indoor radon exposure ranges from 543 [90{\%} uncertainty interval (UI) , 75-1,097] to 3,108 (90{\%} UI, 2,996-3,221) , depending on the model considered. This calculation suggests that from 2.2{\%} (90{\%} UI, 0.3-4.4) to 12.4{\%} (90{\%} UI, 11.9-12.8) of these deaths in France may be attributable to indoor radon. DISCUSSION In this original work we used different exposure-response relations from several epidemiologic studies and found that regardless of the relation chosen, the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to indoor radon appears relatively stable. Smokers can reduce their risk not only by reducing their indoor radon concentration but also by giving up smoking.},

Here, we propose a probabilistic Bayesian approach to forecast the timing of a shift by combining uncertain prior information about the ecosystem dynamics (parameters and drivers) and sampled spatial and temporal correlation and variance of ecosystem states, which are well known early-warning signals. For an ecosystem of logistically growing vegetation under linear increase in grazing pressure, we show that the use of sampled early-warning signals results in lower prediction uncertainty in forecasted timing of shifts compared to forecasts made with sampled mean state variables. In addition, we show that uncertainty in ecosystem parameters decreases well ahead of a shift. An important conclusion of our study is that the use of early-warning signals in forecasting of shifts is promising, provided that a large number of sampl...},

It is shown that below-cloud gas scavenging is determined by non-stationary convective diffusion equation with the effective Peclet number. The obtained equation was analyzed numerically in the case of log-normal droplet size distribution. Calculations of scavenging coefficient and the rates of precipitation scavenging are performed for wet removal of ammonia (NH

It is found also that the scavenging coefficient strongly depends on initial concentration distribution of soluble gaseous pollutants in the atmosphere. It is demonstrated that in the case of linear distribution of the initial concentration of gaseous pollutants whereby the initial concentration of gaseous pollutants decreases with altitude, the scavenging coefficient increases with height in the beginning of rainfall. At the later stage of the rain scavenging coefficient decreases with height in the upper below-cloud layers of the atmosphere. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Droughts are set to increase in frequency and magnitude with climate change, and understanding their influence on ecosystems is imperative. We investigated differences in environmental parameters and nutrients in urban and rural estuaries during a period of prolonged low flow. Sampling was done along each estuary at multiple times to place small-scale variability in the context of land-use differences. No differences were detected between land-use for environmental parameters or nutrients in mean effects or variance structure. Urban estuaries had reduced variation in nutrients over time compared to rural estuaries, which suggested that their concentrations are more stable. Large differences existed within and between individual estuaries, and over time. Low freshwater flow conditions in estuaries provide a glimpse to future climate change impacts of drought, and a baseline upon which pollution and anthropogenic effects can be assessed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The handbook book focuses on residential radon exposure from a public health point of view and provides detailed recommendations on reducing health risks from radon and sound policy options for preventing and mitigating radon exposure. The material in the handbook reflects the epidemiological evidence that indoor radon exposure is responsible for a substantial number of lung cancers in the general population. The material is organized into six chapters, each introduced by key messages. Usually, technical terms are defined the first time they are used, and a glossary is also included. Information is provided on the selection of devices to measure radon levels and on procedures for the reliable measurement of these levels. Discussed also are control options for radon in new dwellings, radon reduction in existing dwellings as well as assessment of the costs and benefits of different radon prevention and remedial actions. Also covered are radon risk communication strategies and organization of national radon programmes. This publication is intended for countries planning to develop their national radon programmes or extend such activities, as well as for stakeholders involved in radon control such as the construction industry and building professionals. The overall goal of this handbook is to provide an up-to-date overview of the major aspects of radon and health. It does not aim to replace existing radiation protection standards, rather it emphasizes issues relevant to the comprehensive planning, implementation and evaluation of national radon programmes.},

abstract = {The Campo de Calatrava Volcanic Field (CCVF) located in central-southern Spain (along with Selva-Emporda in Catalonia, NE Spain) is regarded as one of the most important CO 2 emitting zones in Peninsular Spain. Here, we report and evaluate new molecular and isotopic geochemistry of thermal waters and CO 2- rich gas discharges from the CCVF. Locally, these CO 2 -rich fluid emissions represent the remnants of the past volcanic activity that affected this area from the late Miocene through the Quaternary, with the most recent events occurring in the Holocene. The locations of discharging fluids and previous volcanic centers appear to be aligned along well-defined NW-SE and NNW-SSE lineaments, with subordinate trends in the ENE-WSW direction. The chemical and isotopic composition of the thermal waters suggests a meteoric origin, dominated by three distinct geochemical facies: 1) HCO 3 -Mg(Ca) type waters, associated with a relatively shallow aquifer and related to the interaction of meteoric waters with CO 2 -rich gases, alkaline volcanic products, and sedimentary formations, 2) SO 4 (Cl)-Ca(Mg) type waters, which stems from the two rivers (Guadiana and Jabal{\'{o}}n) that drain Triassic evaporitic rocks before entering the study area, and 3) HCO 3 -Na type waters, hosted in deep geopressurized CO 2 -rich reservoirs within the Ordovician basement rocks. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic compositions (ranging between 0.70415 and 0.71623) and $\delta$ 34 S-SO 4 values (+10.7 to +18.3‰ vs. CDT) of CO 2 -rich fluids are consistent with interactions between water and either the Paleozoic basement, Triassic evaporites, Quaternary volcanic rocks, or a combination thereof. Dissolution of a CO 2 -rich gas phase into the aquifer produces low pH values (down to 5.4) and enhances water-rock interactions causing relatively high salinity (Total Ionic Salinity: up to ∼185 meq/L). Carbon dioxide is by far the most abundant gas constituent (up to 992 mmol/mol) and is dominated by mantle-derived sources as indicated by the combination of relatively high helium isotopic ratios (up to 2.7 R/Ra), high isotopic ratios of carbon in CO 2 (ranging between −6.8 and −3.2‰ V-PDB), and the carbon isotopic signature of TDIC (from −6.8 to +2.2‰ vs. VPDB). In the last two decades, numerous (CO 2 -rich) gas blowouts have occurred in the area during well drillings, suggesting the presence of a geopressurized gas reservoir at relatively shallow depth.},

Thanks to the AGILE Mini-Calorimeter instrument energy range extended up to 100MeV and its flexible trigger logic on sub-millisecond time scales, AGILE is detecting more than 10 TGFs/month, adding a wealth of observations which pose severe constrains on production models. The main AGILE discoveries in TGF science during two and a half years of observations are the following: 1) the TGF spectrum extends well above 40 MeV, 2) the high energy tail of the TGF spectrum is harder than expected and cannot be easily explained by previous theoretical models, 3) TGFs can be localized from space using high-energy photons detected by the AGILE gamma-ray imaging detector. In this presentation we will describe the characteristics of the 2.5-years AGILE TGF sample, focusing on the recent results concerning the TGF high-energy spectral characteristics. },

abstract = {As part of the special dossier in this issue on the geopolitical consequences of climate change, we publish here an article on migration linked to climatic phenomena. Drawing on the leading international studies in the field, {\'{E}}tienne Piguet shows the extent to which climate change could give rise to population movements. Reminding us that this is a theme that has received relatively little attention, he begins by defining the concept closely and underlining the importance of terminology in this field. For example, these migrations will be spoken of as "environmentally induced population movements" rather than as movements of "environmental refugees" - to avoid, among other things, falling foul of the legal regime on refugees as currently defined by the United Nations. He goes on to show what the migratory consequences of global warming might be, as exemplified in three major types of climatic event: storms and floods, droughts and water shortages and, lastly, rises in sea level. As he stresses, this latter phenomenon is probably the only one that would give rise to irreversible migrations (in the other cases, the migrants would generally end up returning to their regions of origin), but it is likely to affect at least 146 million people, if not indeed four times that figure, depending on the time horizon considered. As Piguet reminds us in his concluding remarks, since it is for the moment mainly the industrialized countries that are responsible for the carbon dioxide emissions which are bringing about climate change, it will be difficult for them to wash their hands of responsibility for these potential climate refugees. It is important, then, to gauge the extent of the problem and develop the resources - particularly the preventive resources - to meet it (e.g. combatting global warming, investing in suitable infrastructure, such as protective sea-walls etc.).},

abstract = {of results Exposure to particulate matter of a diameter equal or less than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM 2.5) has been modelled for the year 2016 to provide a comprehensive global coverage of estimates of air quality. The key parameter is the annual average concentration of PM 2.5 , which is highly relevant for estimating health impacts. Modelled exposure to PM 2.5 provides more comprehensive exposure information for countries than measured data that provide information only for a selection of towns and cities. A comprehensive set of estimated population exposures such as the one provided by the DIMAQ model is required when estimating the health impacts of ambient air pollution for a country. Estimates of population exposure are required for all areas, including those that may not be covered by ground monitoring networks. Estimates of air quality, expressed in terms of average concentrations of PM 2.5 are now available for all regions of the world, including areas in which monitoring is not available (Figure 1). Modelled estimates of air quality can be downloaded and consulted interactively at www.who.int/airpollution/data. Figure 1: Global map of annual average concentrations of ambient (outdoor) fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) in g/m 3. In the majority of regions of the world, annual averages of air pollution are higher than the WHO air quality guideline (AQG) level of 10 $\mu$g/m 3 , with particularly high exposures in the Eastern Mediterranean, SouthEast Asian and Western Pacific regions (Figure 2).

From the standpoint of estuarine scientists and resource managers, a major scientific challenge will be to project the estuarine response to ECE that will co-occur with other important environmental changes (i.e., natural climate variability, global warming, sea level rise, eutrophication), as this will affect the provisioning of important ecosystem services provided by estuaries. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In addition, an estimate of the contribution of traffic to the total ambient coarse mode particulate matter in Zurich, Switzerland is provided by estimating the weekly cycle of coarse mode traffic emissions and by comparing it to the weekly cycle of ambient concentrations. The coarse mode data used in the study are the result of simultaneous daily measurements of PM

                        2.5 at seven sites located in Switzerland. The measurements cover a period of 7-12 years for six stations and 3 years for one station. It is found that a coarse mode weekly cycle is present in various types of urban and rural stations. Ambient concentrations on weekdays are higher than on Sundays by a factor of 1.53 on average over all urban and suburban sites and by a factor of 1.32 on average over all rural sites. Moreover, the relative increase of coarse mode ambient concentrations on weekdays compared to Sundays was larger than the relative increase of PM
                        2.5 concentrations by a factor of 2.7 on average over all urban and suburban sites, whereas no considerable difference was found at the rural sites. A calculation of coarse mode traffic emissions for an urban scenario was carried out using traffic-induced dust resuspension and brake wear emission factors for light and heavy duty vehicles and traffic counts from Zurich, Switzerland. It is shown that coarse mode emissions on weekdays are greater than on Sundays by a factor of 2.0. The contribution of traffic to coarse mode urban ambient concentrations was estimated to be 53{\%} (34{\%}-78{\%}) on Sundays and 70{\%} (57{\%}-86{\%}) on weekdays. It is deemed however that these numbers are somewhat overestimating the traffic contribution because of lack of information on construction activities around the considered sites. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

These factors are: Pressure differences between the ambient air and the chamber, wind speed within the chamber, the chamber CO2 concentration relative to ambient air concentration and the accumulation of water vapor in the chamber. A mathematical analysis of the accumulation of CO2 in the chamber in terms of diffusion and advection (e.g., air flow out of the ground at geothermal degassing locations) shows that the same protocol should be followed, whether the mechanism of emission is purely by diffusion or by a combination of diffusion and advection. The analysis also yields a simple way for estimating soil CO2 conductance and the soil CO2 concentration at the depth of insertion of the chamber into the ground. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The overall result was a considerable reduction of radon concentrations after the implementation of new regulations, but the results varied between the different dwelling categories. A statistically significant reduction was found for detached houses where the average radon concentration was almost halved from 76 to 40 Bq/m3. The fraction of detached houses which had at least one frequently occupied room with a radon concentration above the Action Level (100 Bq/m3) fell from 23.9{\%} to 6.4{\%}, while the fraction above the Upper Limit Value (200 Bq/m3) was reduced from 7.6{\%} to 2.5{\%}. In 2008 the average radon concentration measured in terraced and semi-detached houses was 44 and in 2016 it was 29 Bq/m3, but the reduction was not statistically significant. For multifamily houses, it was not possible to draw a conclusion due to insufficient number of measurements.},

abstract = {The gravity model (GM) analogous to Newton's law of universal gravitation has successfully described the flow between different spatial regions, such as human migration, traffic flows, international economic trades, etc. This simple but powerful approach relies only on the 'mass' factor represented by the scale of the regions and the 'geometrical' factor represented by the geographical distance. However, when the population has a subpopulation structure distinguished by different attributes, the estimation of the flow solely from the coarse-grained geographical factors in the GM causes the loss of differential geographical information for each attribute. To exploit the full information contained in the geographical information of subpopulation structure, we generalize the GM for population flow by explicitly harnessing the subpopulation properties characterized by both attributes and geography. As a concrete example, we examine the marriage patterns between the bride and the groom clans of Korea in the past. By exploiting more refined geographical and clan information, our generalized GM properly describes the real data, a part of which could not be explained by the conventional GM. Therefore, we would like to emphasize the necessity of using our generalized version of the GM, when the information on such nongeographical subpopulation structures is available.},

abstract = {In an effort to quantify the geogenic radon soil-gas potential and appraise the use of radon technique as a geological mapping tool in a crystalline basement rock terrain of Ile-Ife Nigeria, radon measurement concentration were made using a radon detector instrument (EDA RD-200) that measures radon isotopes by a scintillator cell coupled to a photomultiplier tube. The data were collected from soils derived from three different lithologic rock units. The observed values were then correlated with the geology of the area. Significant differences in the radon soil-gas concentrations among the three geologic units were observed. Granite gneiss has the highest concentration, followed by grey gneiss and mica schist in that order. The geometric mean (GM) concentration of radon-222 measured in soils directly overlying the three different rock types were 301.4 pCi/l for granite gneiss, 202.8 pCi/l for the grey gneiss, and 199.4 pCi/l for mica schist. Conversely, the average values for radon-220 averaged 1510.0, 815.4, and 733.0 pCi/l for granite gneiss, grey gneiss, and mica schist rocks, respectively. Statistical t test (alpha = 0.05) results indicated that there was no significant difference in the geometric mean of radon soil-gas measured between low and medium potential zones. However, significant differences were found between the low and high radon potential zones, and between the medium and high zones. The low concentrations of radon soil-gas emission observed in this study is explained in terms of the seasonal variation due to thermal convection fluid movement, while the radon concentrations were found to be controlled by the lithology and geochemistry of the underlying bedrock.},

abstract = {Global sea levels have risen by approximately 0.2 m since 1900 (ref. 1), with projections showing continued changes under anthropogenic warming. However, estimates of future global mean sea-level rise (SLR) vary widely; current projections for the year 2100, for example, range from a low of 0.4 m to a high of 2.5 m (refs 2-4), depending on assumptions of future greenhouse gas emissions, thermal expansion, melt of glaciers and the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, and isostatic adjustment as ice sheets disappear 5. These SLR projections are likely conservative, and continued improvements in ice-sheet modelling suggest high-end SLR predictions are increasingly likely 6,7. With global coastal populations totalling more than 600 million (projected to surpass one billion people this century 8), any level of SLR is expected to impact and potentially displace a large population 9,10. As a result, SLR is anticipated to be one of the most expensive and irreversible future consequences of global climate change 9,11-13 , costing up to 4.5{\%} of global gross domestic product 14. The implications of SLR on human migration first appeared in the scientific literature during the late 1970s 16 , when there was increased recognition that disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could lead to major disruption in coastal cities 16 , resulting in migration. It is now understood that SLR influences human migration in multiple ways. The most apparent influence involves permanent, irreversible inunda-tion of low-elevation areas, which, under SLR, renders land uninhabitable and unavailable for livelihoods 10,12,17 , necessitating relocation. However, various other hazards associated with SLR will also impact migration patterns and, in fact, will exert their influence considerably sooner than complete inundation. Hazards include saltwater intrusion into groundwater and agricultural soils 18-23 , coastal flooding 24-26 , shifts in sediment regimes 27 , coastal erosion 28,29 and increased inland penetration of tropical storm surges 30-33. These hazards could spur migration by permanently destroying irrigated coastal agriculture and fresh drinking water supplies 34,35 , disrupting vital human systems 36-38 , reducing property values 39,40 and, ultimately, destroying property and infrastructure 41,42. SLR also threatens coastal livelihoods such as tourism 43 , coastal aquiculture 44 , fisheries 45 and silviculture 46 , indirectly pressuring migration through adverse impacts on job security. Since the first studies to quantify population displacement due to SLR 15 , our fundamental understanding of SLR and human migration has rapidly advanced with the development of basic theory on climate-change migration 47-50 , empirical case studies of historical analogues for future SLR 51-55 , integrated economic analysis and modelling of SLR retreat 56-58 , explicit models of SLR migration 50,59-61 , as well as contentious policy discussions on the need for coastal retreat 62-65. In some cases, studies even question if SLR will spur widespread migration at all 66,67 , as demonstrated by island residents in the Philippines who would rather adapt in place to SLR-related hazards than follow a relocation programme to the mainland 67. Abstract | Anthropogenic sea-level rise (SLR) is predicted to impact, and, in many cases, displace, a large proportion of the population via inundation and heightened SLR-related hazards. With the global coastal population projected to surpass one billion people this century, SLR might be among the most costly and permanent future consequences of climate change. In this Review, we synthesize the rapidly expanding knowledge of human mobility and migration responses to SLR, providing a coherent roadmap for future SLR research and associated policy. While it is often assumed that direct inundation forces a migration, we discuss how mobility responses are instead driven by a diversity of socioeconomic and demographic factors, which, in some cases, do not result in a migration response. We link SLR hazards with potential mechanisms of migration and the associated governmental or institutional policies that operate as obstacles or facilitators for that migration. Specific examples from the USA, Bangladesh and atoll island nations are used to contextualize these concepts. However, further research is needed on the fundamental mechanisms underlying SLR migration, tipping points, thresholds and feedbacks, risk perception and migration to fully understand migration responses to SLR.},

abstract = {The Sarno River Basin (south-west Italy), nestled between the Somma–Vesuvius volcanic complex and the limestone formations of the Campania–Apennine Chain, is one of the most polluted river basins in Europe due to widespread industrialization and intensive agriculture. Water from the Sarno River, which is heavily contaminated by the discharge of human and industrial wastes, is partially used for irrigation on the agricultural fields surrounding it. We apply compositional data analysis to 319 soil samples, collected during two field campaigns along the river course and throughout the basin, to determine the concentration and possible origin (anthropogenic and/or geogenic) of the elemental anomalies, including potentially toxic elements (PTEs). The concentrations of 53 elements were determined using ICP-MS and, subsequently, log-transformed. Using hierarchical clustering, clr-biplot and a principal factor analysis, the variability and the correlations between a subset of extracted variables (26 elements) were identified. Factor score interpolated maps were then generated using both lognormal data (NDR) and clr-transformed data to better visualize the distribution and potential sources of the patterns in the Sarno Basin. The underlying geology substrata appear to be associated with raised levels of Na, K, P, Rb, Ba, V, Co, B, Zr, and Li, due to the presence of pyroclastic rocks from Mt. Somma–Vesuvius. Similarly, elevated Pb, Zn, Cd, and Hg concentrations are most likely related to the geological and anthropogenic sources, the underlying volcanic rocks, and contamination from fossil fuel combustion associated with nearby urban centers. Interpolated factor score maps and the clr-biplot show a clear correlation between Ni and Cr in samples taken along the Sarno River, and Ca and Mg near the Solofra district. After considering nearby anthropogenic sources, the Ni and Cr are PTEs most likely originating from the Solofra tannery industry, while Ca and Mg correlate to the underlying limestone-rich soils of the area. This study shows the applicability of the log-ratio transformations to these studies, as they clearly show relationships and dependencies between elements which can be lost when univariate and classical multivariate analyses are employed on raw and lognormal data.},

The mining, minerallurgic and metallurgic activities in the area, as well as the local geological (metallogenetic) conditions, are important sources of heavy metals in the environment, resulting in considerable soil contamination. The study area occupies a surface area of 126 km2, divided into grid squares of 1 km2 for soil sampling, in order to characterise the geochemical background of this abandoned mining region. The soil samples were analysed for total concentrations of 32 elements; the discussion focuses on eight in particular (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, As, Cd, Sb and Mn), these being the main elements associated with human activity. The mean contents of all these elements exceed the Clarke comparison values for trace elements in acid igneous rocks. The total concentrations of Pb, Ag, As, Cd and Sb are especially high. In this very complex zone, on the basis of cluster analysis and of field observations, the local background contents of each geological substrate are defined, distinguishing the different types of activity that took place in the zone and different degrees of intensity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The CO2 degassing process from a large area on the Tyrrhenian side of central Italy, probably related to the input into the upper crust of mantle fluids, was investigated in detail through the geochemical study of gas emissions and groundwater. Mass-balance calculations and carbon isotopes show that over 50{\%} of the inorganic carbon in regional groundwater is derived from a deep source highlighting gas-liquid separation processes at depth. The deep carbonate-evaporite regional aquifer acts as the main CO2 reservoir and when total pressure of the reservoir fluid exceeds hydrostatic pressure, a free gas phase separates from the parent liquid and escapes toward the surface generating gas emissions which characterise the study area. The distribution of the CO2 flux anomalies and the location of high PCO2 springs and gas emissions suggest that the storage and the expulsion of the CO2 toward the atmosphere are controlled by the geological and structural setting of the shallow crust. The average CO2 flux and the total amount of CO2 discharged by the study area were computed using surface heat flow, enthalpy and CO2 molality of the liquid phase circulating in the deep carbonate-evaporite aquifer. The results show that the CO2 flux varies from 1 ?? 104??mol y- 1??km- 2 to 5 ?? 107??mol y- 1??km- 2, with an average value of 4.8 ?? 106??mol y- 1??km- 2, about five times higher than the value of 1 ?? 106??mol y- 1 derived by Kerrick et al.

abstract = {Understanding the broad-scale ramifications of accelerated sea level rise requires maps of the land that could be inundated or eroded. Producing such maps requires a combination of elevation information and models of shoreline erosion, wetland accretion, and other coastal processes. Assessments of coastal areas in the United States that combine all of these factors have focused on relatively small areas, usually 25 to 30 km wide. In many cases, the results are as sensitive to uncertainty regarding geological processes as to the rate of sea level rise. This paper presents maps illustrating the elevations of lands close to sea level. Although elevation contours do not necessarily coincide with future shorelines, the former is more transparent and less dependent on subjective modeling. Several methods are available for inferring elevations given limited data. This paper uses the US Geological Survey (USGS) 1° digital elevation series and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shoreline data to illustrate the land below the 1.5 and 3.5 m contours for areas the size of entire US states or larger. The maps imply that approximately 58 000 km2 of land along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts lie below the 1.5 m contour. Louisiana, Florida, Texas, and North Carolina account for more than 80{\%} of the low land. Outside of those 4 states, the largest vulnerable populated region is the land along the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay stretching from Dorchester County, Maryland, to Accomac County, Virginia.},

abstract = {Patterns of regeneration and burial of phosphorus (P) in the Baltic Sea are strongly dependent on redox conditions. Redox varies spatially along water depth gradients and temporally in response to the seasonal cycle and multidecadal hydrographic variability. Alongside the well-documented link between iron oxyhydroxide dissolution and release of P from Baltic Sea sediments, we show that preferential remineralization of P with respect to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) during degradation of organic matter plays a key role in determining the surplus of bioavailable P in the water column. Preferential remineralization of P takes place both in the water column and upper sediments and its rate is shown to be redox-dependent, increasing as reducing conditions become more severe at greater water-depth in the deep basins. Existing Redfield-based biogeochemical models of the Baltic may therefore underestimate the imbalance between N and P availability for primary production, and hence the vulnerability of the Baltic to sustained eutrophication via the fixation of atmospheric N. However, burial of organic P is also shown to increase during multidecadal intervals of expanded hypoxia, due to higher net burial rates of organic matter around the margins of the deep basins. Such intervals may be characterized by basin-scale acceleration of all fluxes within the P cycle, including productivity, regeneration and burial, sustained by the relative accessibility of the water column P pool beneath a shallow halocline.},

abstract = {Pumice flows are potentially destructive volcanic events that derive from eruption column collapse and whose dynamics are poorly understood. The challenges in studying these flows include the lack of constraints on the dynamics, kinematics and initial conditions that control their emplacement. We present a morphological study of the distal deposits (lobes) of the pumice flows resulting from the 1993 eruption at Lascar, Chile. The surface geometry of the lobes was measured in detail using a LiDAR device, which allowed for detailed characterisation of their morphology, consisting of central channel and lateral levees, and terminal frontal snout. In particular we find that the ratio of channel/levee height as a function of the ratio of the distance between levees/total width of the lobe has a characteristic curve for these pumice flow lobes. Our analysis of several of the Lascar pumice lobe deposits (south east sector) identified several dimensionless groups of the available parameters which, when compared against published results from both experimental and numerical investigations, allowed us to constrain crucial kinematic and dynamic information on the terminal phase of the pumice flows. Notably, we estimate the velocity of the terminal phase of pumice flows to be 5-10. m/s. Froude numbers of 1.5-2 are comparable with values found for experimental granular flows. Height-width aspect ratios for the levee-channel section of the pumice lobes are similar to those for experimental flows although these same aspect ratios for the snout are much larger for the natural deposits than their small-scale analogues. Finally, we discuss the possible emplacement dynamics of the terminal Lascar 1993 pumice flows. A pseudo-Reynolds number based on the velocity estimation is found to be up to 100 times larger for the pumice flows than experimental-scale flows. This suggests that the flow-retarding frictional forces for large-scale flows are relatively unimportant compared to flows at smaller scales. Mechanical effects such as fluidisation, mobilisation of material lying on the slopes over which they propagate and lubrication due to polydispersivity could provide an explanation for their ability to propagate on shallow slopes (6-11°). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {CO2flux measurements at the soil-atmosphere interface are commonly carried out as part of site characterization in areas elected for CO2geological storage purposes. This approach represents an important monitoring tool to detect and quantify leakages during operational and post-operational stages related to the injection of anthropogenic CO2.A large variety of techniques to measure diffuse CO2soil flux is available and one of the most widely used is the accumulation chamber method. With this method, the total output is statistically estimated after measuring the CO2flux in selected points of a certain area. Several statistical approaches can be applied and it is important to select the most representative and significant procedure. Consequently, in this paper six different methods were used to calculate the total CO2output, as follows: arithmetic mean, minimum variances unbiased estimator, bootstrap resample, partitioning of data into different populations with graphical and maximum likelihood procedures, and sequential Gaussian simulation.Eight campaigns were carried out in the Hontom{\'{i}}n CO2Storage Technology Development Plant (Burgos, Spain) and in natural analogs of CO2storage (Campo de Calatrava, Spain and Mt. Amiata, Caprese Michelangelo and La Solfatara, Italy). Our results showed that sequential Gaussian simulation is the most precise method for evaluating the total CO2output and the respective confidence interval. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total CO2output with other statistical methodologies allowed to develop an application procedure for choosing the most reliable and realistic approach.},

abstract = {A set of analytical instruments, consisting of a gas chromatograph for water and carbon dioxide, an alpha scintillation counter to measure radon and a temperature sensor, was especially designed and constructed to monitor volcanic gases and was successfully operated over weeks in the high temperature fumaroles at the summit of Merapi Volcano, Indonesia. The analytical unit runs automatically and is remote controlled through a radio-link. Over a period of several weeks, concentrations of H2O and CO2 were measured every 35 min and Rn activity was monitored at about 90-min intervals. The fumarole temperatures were continuously recorded every minute from July 2000 to the end of January 2001. The composition and temperature of the gas emitted at Merapi Volcano show significant variations. Due to a regular stronger degassing of the magma, concentrations of CO2 increase periodically while H2O concentrations decrease. On the other hand, Rn activity rises with increasing atmospheric pressure and higher water concentrations. After intensive rainfall, infiltration of cold meteoric water into the volcanic edifice possibly causes an increase in the concentration of water vapour and a decrease in the temperature of the gases in the fumarole. Several seismic events recorded at Merapi correlate with gas temperature. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Global Climate Risk Index 2017 analyses to what extent countries have been affected by the impacts of weather-related loss events (storms, floods, heat waves etc.). This year's 12th edition of the analysis reconfirms that, according to the Climate Risk Index, less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialised countries. Regarding future climate change, the Climate Risk Index may serve as a red flag for already existing vulnerability that may further increase in regions where extreme events will become more frequent or more severe due to climate change. While some vulnerable developing countries are frequently hit by extreme events, there are also some others where such disasters are a rare occurrence. The most recent data available – from 2015 and 1996–2015 – were taken into account to produce the following key messages: According to the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index, Honduras, Myanmar and Haiti were the countries most affected by extreme weather events between 1996 and 2015. In 2015, Mozambique, Dominica as well as Malawi were at the top of the list of the most affected countries. Altogether, more than 528 000 people died as a direct result of nearly 11 000 extreme weather events; and losses between 1996 and 2015 amounted to around 3.08 trillion US{\$} (in Purchasing Power Parities). The host region of the UN climate summit 2016 – the continent of Africa – is severely affected by climatic events with four countries ranking among the 10 countries worldwide most affected in 2015 – Mozambique (1st), Malawi (3rd), Ghana and Madagascar (joint 8th position). Precipitation, floods and landslides were the major causes of damage in 2015. A high incidence of extreme precipitation supports the scientific expectations of accelerated hydrological cycles caused by climate warming. Most of the affected countries in the Bottom 10 of the long-term index have a high ranking due to exceptional catastrophes. Over the last few years another category of countries has been gaining relevance: Countries like the Philippines and Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long term index and in the index for the respective year for the last six years. Of the ten most affected countries (1996–2015), nine were developing countries in the low income or lower-middle income country group, while only one was classified as an upper-middle income country. The climate summit in Marrakesh is giving the “go-ahead” on developing the “rulebook” for the Paris Agreement, including the global adaptation goal, adaptation communication systems, and finance assessment systems for building resilience. A review of the UNFCCC's work on loss and damage provides the opportunity to better detail the next 5-year's work on loss and damage, in relation to the climate regime, as well as to better understand exactly how loss and damage should be taken up under the Paris Agreement.},

While previous studies have provided estimates of populations potentially exposed to various climate impacts, little work has been done to assess the number of people that may actually be displaced or where they will choose to go. Here we modify a diffusion-based model of human mobility in combination with population, geographic, and climatic data to estimate the sources, destinations, and flux of potential migrants as driven by sea level rise (SLR) in Bangladesh in the years 2050 and 2100. Using only maps of population and elevation, we predict that 0.9 million people (by year 2050) to 2.1 million people (by year 2100) could be displaced by direct inundation and that almost all of this movement will occur locally within the southern half of the country. We also find that destination locations should anticipate substantial additional demands on jobs (594 000), housing (197 000), and food (783 × 109 calories) by mid-century as a result of those displaced by SLR. By linking the sources of migrants displaced by SLR with their likely destinations, we demonstrate an effective approach for predicting climate-driven migrant flows, especially in data-limited settings.},

@article{Raco2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: Landfill gas (LFG) tends to escape from the landfill surface even when LFG collecting systems are installed. Since LFG leaks are generally a noticeable percentage of the total production of LFG, the optimisation of the collection system is a fundamental step for both energy recovery and environmental impact mitigation. In this work, we suggest to take into account the results of direct measurements of gas fluxes at the air-cover interface to achieve this goal.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: During the last 5 years (2004-2009), 11 soil gas emission surveys have been carried out at the Municipal Solid Waste landfill of Legoli (Peccioli municipality, Pisa Province, Italy) by means of the accumulation chamber method. Direct and simultaneous measurements of CH(4) and CO(2) fluxes from the landfill cover (about 140,000 m(2)) have been performed to estimate the total output of both gases discharged into the atmosphere. Three different data processing have been applied and compared: Arithmetic mean of raw data (AMRD), sequential Gaussian conditional simulations (SGCS) and turning bands conditional simulations (TBCS). The total amount of LFG (captured and not captured) obtained from processing of direct measurements has been compared with the corresponding outcomes of three different numerical models (LandGEM, IPCC waste model and GasSim).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Measured fluxes vary from undetectable values ({\textless}0.05 mol m(-2) day(-1) for CH(4) and {\textless}0.02 mol m(-2) day(-1) for CO(2)) to 246 mol m(-2) day(-1) for CH(4) and 275 mol m(-2) day(-1) for CO(2). The specific CH(4) and CO(2) fluxes (flux per surface unit) vary from 1.8 to 7.9 mol m(-2) day(-1) and from 2.4 to 7.8 mol m(-2) day(-1), respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: The three different estimation methodologies (AMRD, SGCS and TBCS) used to evaluate the total output of diffused CO(2) and CH(4) fluxes from soil provide similar estimations, whereas there are some mismatches between these results and those of numerical LFG production models. Isoflux maps show a non-uniform spatial distribution, with high-flux zones not always corresponding with high-temperature areas shown by thermographic images.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The average value estimated over the 5-year period for the Legoli landfill is 245 mol min(-1) for CH(4) and 379 mol min(-1) for CO(2), whereas the volume percentage of CH(4) in the total gas discharged into the atmosphere varies from 29{\%} to 51{\%}, with a mean value of 39{\%}. The estimated yearly emissions from the landfill cover is about 1.29 x 10(8) mol annum(-1) (2,100 t year(-1)) of CH(4) and 1.99 x 10(8) mol annum(-1) (8,800 t year(-1)) of CO(2). Considering that the CH(4) global warming potential is 63 times greater than that of CO(2) (20 a time horizon, Lashof and Ahuja 1990), the emission of methane corresponds to 130,000 t annum(-1) of CO(2).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The importance of these studies is to provide data for the worldwide inventory of CH(4) and CO(2) emissions from landfills, with the ultimate aim of determining the contribution of waste disposal to global warming. This kind of studies could be extended to other gas species, like the volatile organic compounds.},

abstract = {In the general population, evaluation of lung cancer risk from radon in houses is hampered by low levels of exposure and by dosimetric uncertainties due to residential mobility. To address these limitations, the authors conducted a case-control study in a predominantly rural area of China with low mobility and high radon levels. Included were all lung cancer cases diagnosed between January 1994 and April 1998, aged 30-75 years, and residing in two prefectures. Randomly selected, population-based controls were matched on age, sex, and prefecture. Radon detectors were placed in all houses occupied for 2 or more years during the 5-30 years prior to enrollment. Measurements covered 77{\%} of the possible exposure time. Mean radon concentrations were 230.4 Bq/m(3) for cases (n = 768) and 222.2 Bq/m(3) for controls (n = 1,659). Lung cancer risk increased with increasing radon level (p {\textless} 0.001). When a linear model was used, the excess odds ratios at 100 Bq/m(3) were 0.19 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.05, 0.47) for all subjects and 0.31 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.10, 0.81) for subjects for whom coverage of the exposure interval was 100{\%}. Adjusting for exposure uncertainties increased estimates by 50{\%}. Results support increased lung cancer risks with indoor radon exposures that may equal or exceed extrapolations based on miner data.},

This article outlines a methodology to assess emissions and emission reductions from peatland rewetting projects using vegetation as a proxy. Vegetation seems well qualified for indicating GHG fluxes from peat soils as it reflects long-term water level, affects GHG emissions via assimilate supply and aerenchyma and allows fine-scaled mapping. The methodology includes mapping of vegetation types characterised by the presence and absence of species groups indicative for specific water level classes. GHG flux values are assigned to the vegetation types following a standardized protocol and using published emission values from plots with similar vegetation and water level in regions with similar climate and flora. Carbon sequestration in trees is accounted for by estimating the annual sequestration in tree biomass from forest inventory data. The method follows the criteria of the Voluntary Carbon Standard and is illustrated using the example of two Belarusian peatlands.},

The specific surface area of the samples ranged from 43.8 to 52.5 cm2 g-1, where the particle size for all soil horizons is lognormally distributed, which modal values of the particle radius undersize ranging from 107 up to 203 ??m. The values for the released radon were between 26 and 194 pCi, which allowed to estimate emanation coefficients for these materials between 0.1 and 0.2, within the context of other values reported elsewhere. Soils derived from Carboniferous limestone and characterized by higher pH, exchangeable calcium, and the presence of U, but with a lower 234U/238U activity ratio, yielded the highest values for released Rn; however, this trend was not observed for dissolved U and its respective 234U/238U activity ratio, when considering the less aggressive etchant. Uranium is mobilized from rock matrix to A and B horizons in the analysed soil profiles, where its enrichment is about 10 times higher in soils derived from Carboniferous limestone. These data also permitted an evaluation of a theoretical model for the generation of Rn in soils and its transfer to water, in order to interpret the radioactivity due to this gas in groundwaters from the Mendip Hills district, England.},

Spatial demographic projections are widely used as inputs to spatial projections of land use, energy use, and emissions, as well as to assessments of the impacts of extreme events, sea level rise, and other climate-related outcomes. To date, however, there are very few global-scale, spatially explicit population projections, and those that do exist are often based on simple scaling or trend extrapolation. Here we present a new set of global, spatially explicit population scenarios that are consistent with the new Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed to facilitate global change research. We use a parameterized gravity-based downscaling model to produce projections of spatial population change that are quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections for the SSPs and qualitatively consistent with assumptions in the SSP narratives regarding spatial development patterns. We show that the five SSPs lead to substantially different spatial population outcomes at the continental, national, and sub-national scale. In general, grid cell-level outcomes are most influenced by national-level population change, second by urbanization rate, and third by assumptions about the spatial style of development. However, the relative importance of these factors is a function of the magnitude of the projected change in total population and urbanization for each country and across SSPs. We also demonstrate variation in outcomes considering the example of population existing in a low-elevation coastal zone under alternative scenarios.},

abstract = {It is one thing to have a discussion or write about a one- or two-foot rise in the ocean surface and potential impacts to a local community; it is another to show someone a map highlighting the areas that would potentially be impacted. The ability to visualize the potential depth and inland extent of water gives us a better understanding of the corresponding impacts and consequences. Mapping sea level changes in a geographic information system (GIS) gives the user the ability to overlay the potentially impacted areas with other data such as critical infrastructure, roads, ecologically sensitive areas, demographics, and economics. Providing maps on the Web via Internet mapping technologies enables the user to have an interactive experience that truly brings out the "visual" part of the map definition. Over the past several years, the lessons learned from investigating pilot sea level change mapping applications have led to the development of a next-generation sea level rise and coastal flooding viewer. In addition, new mapping techniques have been developed to use high-resolution data sources to show flooding impacts on local public infrastructure, mapping confidence, flooding frequency, marsh impacts, and social and economic impacts from potential inundation. This paper will provide a brief history of previous sea level change visualization pilot projects, detailed discussion of new methods, current status of new tool development and outputs, and future plans for expanding to the rest of the U.S. {\textcopyright} 2011 ASCE.},

@article{Dibben1999,
abstract = {The need to examine the vulnerability of people to natural hazards, in addition to the long-established requirement to study extreme events of nature, is being increasingly recognised within disaster research. Following a discussion of the nature of human vulnerability, we propose a framework for its analysis within the context of volcanic activity and we exemplify our approach by a detailed study of Furnas, a village located at the centre of a volcano with the same name on the island of Sao Miguel in the Azores. The methods used included in-depth interviews with permanent residents (n = 50), analysis of census records and an examination of the socio-economic history of the town. The vulnerability of an individual to volcanic hazards involves a complex interaction of elements which, in addition to the usual factors taken into account in programmes of hazard reduction (e.g., the nature of the physical threat, location and economic situation), also comprises his or her social context and a number of physiological and psychological considerations. It is argued, further, that both generally and in the case of Furnas, the root causes of vulnerability lie in the history and development of society. Individual decision making is fundamental but takes place within and cannot be separated from this social context. Vulnerability analysis allows the identification of points where intervention may be successful in reducing the likelihood of suffering in a society. It avoids the problem of people's unexpected reactions to invention leading to a changing or even increasing level of vulnerability, by studying society rather than just one aspect of volcanic hazard in isolation.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new method to monitor continuously soil CO 2 profiles using small solid-state CO2 sensors buried at different depths of the soil. Based on the measurement of soil CO2 profile and a gaseous diffusivity model, we estimated soil CO2 efflux, which was mainly from heterotrophic respiration, and its temporal variation in a dry season in a Mediterranean savanna ecosystem in California. The daily mean values of CO2 concentrations in soils had small variation, but the diurnal variation was significant and correlated well with soil temperature. The daily mean CO2 concentration remained steady at 396 ??mol mol-1 at 2 cm depth during the dry summer from days 200 to 235 in 2002. Over the same period, CO2 concentration decreased from 721 to 611 ??mol mol-1 at 8 cm depth, and from 1044 to 871 ??mol mol-1 at 16 cm. The vertical soil CO2 concentrations changed almost linearly with depth up to 16 cm, but the gradient varied over time. Based on the soil CO2 gradient and the diffusion coefficient estimated from the Millington-Quirk model, continuous soil CO 2 efflux was calculated. The daily mean values of CO2 efflux slightly decreased from 0.43 to 0.33 ??mol m-2 s -1 with a mean of 0.37 ??mol m-2 s-1. The mean diurnal range of CO2 efflux was greater than the range of daily mean CO2 efflux within the study period. The diurnal variation of soil CO2 efflux ranged from 0.32 to 0.45 ??mol m-2 s-1 with the peak value reached between 14:30 and 16:30 h. This pattern corresponded well with the increase in soil temperatures during this time. By plotting CO2 efflux vs. soil temperature, we found that CO2 efflux correlated exponentially with soil temperature at the depth of 8 cm, with R2 of 0.86 and Q10 of 1.27 in the summer dry season. The Q10 value increased with the depth of soil temperature measurements. The high correlation between CO2 efflux and temperature explains the diurnal pattern of CO2 efflux, but moisture may become another factor driving the seasonal pattern when moisture changes over seasons. The estimated CO2 efflux using this method was very close to chamber measurements, suggesting that this method can be used for long-term continuous measurements of soil CO2 efflux. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the United States Microbead Free Waters Act are credited for being ambitious in their goals for protecting the marine environment from microplastics pollution. As a result, the microplastic pollution of marine environments and the incidence of microplastic ingestion by fish is rapidly receiving an increase in overdue attention. This commentary summarizes recent discoveries regarding the potential negative effects of micro- and nanoplastic ingestion by fish. Analysis shows that the occurrence of microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract of fish is ephemeral, with low accumulation potential in the gastrointestinal tract, although translocation to the liver may occur. Nevertheless, the total load of micro- and nanoplastics that will pass through the gastrointestinal tract of a fish in its lifetime is likely high and will keep increasing in the future. This may pose a risk because there is evidence that micro- and nanoplastic ingestion can interfere with fish health. Observed effects of microplastics ingestion include (but are not necessarily limited to) intestinal blockage, physical damage, histopathological alterations in the intestines, change in behavior, change in lipid metabolism, and transfer to the liver.},

abstract = {Determination of the natural radioactivity has been carried out, by means of gamma-ray spectrometry system, in surface soil samples collected from various geological formations in urban areas of the northern highlands of Jordan. These highlands, extending from Yarmouk River in the north to Wadi Wala in the south, form the agriculturally important regions of Jordan. Soils of the study region, at which about 70{\%} of the total population of the country are living, mainly originated from limestones that are locally used in construction materials, making the evaluation of environmental radioactivity and estimating the current radiation hazards to the population an interesting issue. The total average concentrations of radionuclides 226Ra, 238U, 232Th, and 40K were 42.5, 49.9, 26.7, and 291.1 Bq kg-1, respectively. Correlations made among these radionuclides prove the existence of secular equilibrium in the investigated soils. The total average absorbed dose rate in the study areas is found to be 51.5 nGy h-1, whereas the annual effective dose equivalent has an average value of 63.2 ??Sv y-1. The external and internal hazard indices, the radium equivalent activity, and the annual gonadal dose equivalent associated with the investigated soils do not exceed the permissible limits except for soils originated from phosphate rocks. Moreover, the radio-elemental concentrations of uranium, thorium and potassium, evaluated for the various geological features in the study areas were calculated to indicate whether relative depletion/enrichment of radioisotopes had occurred. The results of the present study were discussed and compared with internationally recommended values. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

During their ascent, the gases are trapped in deep structures, made up of Mesozoic permeable limestones covered by impermeable terrains, which become sources of a high CO2 flux toward the surface. The anomalous CO2 concentrations are detectable in groundwaters. The general map of the groundwater PCO2 values showes a decrease in the CO2 production moving from the western geothermal areas of Tuscany and Latium to the eastern sector, which is characterized by a normal heat flow. The PCO2 distribution suggests that the NW-SE extensional faults, which bound Plio-Pleistocene grabens, provide the easiest routes for the gas ascent. The geological, geophysical and geothermal deep drilling data suggest that the CO2 anomalies found in the western sectors correspond to deep permeable structures of possible geothermal interest. ?? 1995.},

We correlated radon concentrations with municipal mortality due to these malignant tumors during the period 1999-2008. We calculated the relative risk of dying of brain cancers for each municipality and correlated this value with municipal radon concentration using Spearman's Rho. 251 municipalities were included, with close to 3,500 radon measurements and an average of 14 radon measurements at each municipality. We observed a significant correlation between residential radon with brain cancer mortality for males and females and the intensity of the correlation was higher for females. These results were reinforced when the analysis was restricted to municipalities with more than 5 radon measurements: Spearman's Rho 0.286 (p-value {\textless} 0.001) and Spearman's Rho 0.509 (p-value {\textless} 0.001) for males and females, respectively.

abstract = {We studied microbially mediated diagenetic processes driven by carbon mineralization in subseafloor sediment of the northeastern Bering Sea Slope to a depth of 745meters below seafloor (mbsf). Sites U1343, U1344 and U1345 were drilled during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 323 at water depths of 1008 to 3172m. They are situated in the high productivity "Green Belt" region, with organic carbon burial rates typical of the high-productivity upwelling domains on western continental margins. The three sites show strong geochemical similarities. The downward sequence of microbially mediated processes in the sediment encompasses (1) organoclastic sulfate reduction, (2) anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to sulfate reduction, and (3) methanogenesis. The sediment contains two distinct zones of diagenetic carbonate formation, located at the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) and between 300 and 400mbsf. The SMTZ at the three sites is located between 6 and 9mbsf. The upward methane fluxes into the SMTZ are similar to fluxes in SMTZs underlying high-productivity surface waters off Chile and Namibia. Our Bering Sea results show that intense organic carbon mineralization drives high ammonium and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production rates ({\textgreater}4.2mmolm-3y-1) in the uppermost 10mbsf and strongly imprints on the stable carbon isotope composition of DIC, driving it to a minimum value of -27??? (VPDB) at the SMTZ. Pore-water calcium and magnesium profiles demonstrate formation of diagenetic Mg-rich calcite in the SMTZ. Below the SMTZ, methanogenesis results in 13C-enrichment of pore-water DIC, with a maximum value of +11.9??? The imprint of methanogenesis on the DIC carbon isotope composition is evident down to a depth of 150mbsf. Below this depth, slow or absent microbially mediated carbon mineralization leaves DIC isotope composition unaffected. Ongoing carbonate formation between 300 and 400 mbsf strongly influences pore-water DIC and magnesium concentration profiles. The linked succession of organic carbon mineralization and carbonate dissolution and precipitation patterns that we observe in the Bering Sea Slope sediment may be representative of passive continental margin settings in high-productivity areas of the world's ocean. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The methodology integrates site characterization and modeling to predict the statistical properties of natural CO2 fluxes, the transport of CO2 from potential subsurface leakage points, and the detection of CO2 surface fluxes by the monitoring network. The probability of leak detection is computed as the probability that the leakage signal is sufficient to increase the total flux beyond a statistically determined threshold. The methodology is illustrated for a highly idealized site monitored with CO2 accumulation chamber measurements taken on a uniform grid.

Results for the radon diffusion coefficient measurements in more than 80 insulating materials are summarized. We have discovered that great differences exist in diffusion properties, because the diffusion coefficient varies within four orders from 10-13 m2/s to 10-10 m2/s. A methodological approach is proposed in order to identify the minimal thickness of radon-proof membranes, depending on building and soil characteristics.

abstract = {Continuous222Rn monitoring in soil gas since November 22, 2004 has revealed variability in activity concentration with time in the semi-natural woods on the campus of Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan. Among various factors affecting soil radon levels and variability, temperature was found to be dominant during three seasons when activity concentrations of222Rn showed a diurnal high and nocturnal low with a boundary around 10 o'clock in the morning. This pattern was disturbed by low pressure fronts with occasional rain. The activity gradually decreased as soil temperatures decreased from late November to mid-December. After the ground surface was completely covered with snow, soil radon levels became low with a small fluctuation. There were several peaks of222Rn on the time-series chart in winter. Those peaks appearing in early winter and early spring may be interpreted by considering meteorological parameters. In a few cases, the radon activity suddenly increased with increasing pressure in the soil at a depth of 10 cm, which may be associated with subsurface events such as seismic activity in the area. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A summary of geochemical techniques for purposes of determination of a baseline condition and subsequent monitoring of potential gas microseepage from CO2-EOR or geologic sequestration is presented. The methods include; above ground open-atmosphere techniques, measurements at the land surface-atmosphere interface, and shallow subsurface sampling and measurements. The advantages and disadvantages are presented based on previously published measurements utilizing these techniques. The monitoring for seepage from a CO2-EOR or geologic sequestration project might logically focus on measurements of CO2. Carbon dioxide measurements, particularly in the atmosphere will suffer some quantifiable disadvantages; relatively high atmospheric concentration for a tracer, high environmental variance, multiple natural sources, and solubility/reactivity with water. These factors combine to suggest that CO2 may not effectively serve as an early warning tracer or surface indicator of seepage. Other methods and tracers that are discussed focus on gas exchange measured at the surface and shallow soil gas measurements utilizing a variety of tracers. These parameters include; CO2, CH4 and light hydrocarbons, stable carbon isotopic measurements of carbon-containing gases, carbon-14 content of CO2, inert gases, and artificial tracers entrained in the injected CO2. Use of secondary carbonates in the soil or upper portion of the sedimentary column and their readily measured stable isotopic ratios, and composition of shallow groundwater are included. These materials can be useful in the baseline characterization and provide evidence for fossil gas leakage from depth. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Accounting for as much as 14{\%} of all lung cancers worldwide, cumulative radon progeny exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer among never-smokers both internationally and in the United States. To understand the risk of radon progeny exposure, studies have mapped radon potential using aircraft-based measurements of gamma emissions. However, these efforts are hampered in urban areas where the built environment obstructs aerial data collection. To address part of this limitation, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using in situ gamma readings (taken with a scintillation probe attached to a ratemeter) to assess radon potential in an urban environment: DeKalb County, part of the Atlanta metropolitan area, Georgia, USA. After taking gamma measurements at 402 survey sites, empirical Bayesian kriging was used to create a continuous surface of predicted gamma readings for the county. We paired these predicted gamma readings with indoor radon concentration data from 1351 residential locations. Statistical tests showed the interpolated gamma values were significantly but weakly positively related with indoor radon concentrations, though this relationship is decreasingly informative at finer geographic scales. Geology, gamma readings, and indoor radon were interrelated, with granitic gneiss generally having the highest gamma readings and highest radon concentrations and ultramafic rock having the lowest of each. Our findings indicate the highest geogenic radon potential may exists in the relatively undeveloped southeastern part of the county. It is possible that in situ gamma, in concert with other variables, could offer an alternative to aerial radioactivity measurements when determining radon potential, though future work will be needed to address this project's limitations.},

abstract = {Context. A fundamental step to produce realistic models of the solar phenomena requiring fast (and high power) triggering events is to understand the feasibility of a spontaneous transition from a slow to a fast reconnection regime in the solar environment and its macroscopic evolution within the theoretical framework of pure resistive magnetohydrodynamics. {\{}{\textless}{\}}BR /{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} Aims: We show the dynamical evolution of a reconnecting force-free magnetic field in a “simplified” solar atmosphere (high chromosphere-low corona) described by a pressure-balanced configuration with a variable density modeling the transition region. Magnetic reconnection plays a fundamental role in this region and we show the efficient working of a non-steady and self-feeding reconnection process whose development as determined by characteristic solar parameters (global resistivity, global viscosity, plasma beta) is followed. {\{}{\textless}{\}}BR /{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} Methods: This work presents a 2.5-dimensional simulation study of the instability of force-free current-sheets located in a medium with a strong density variation along the current layer. In order to reach the needed high resolution and to reduce the influence of spurious numerical effects, we use a code with a fully-implicit-particle (or Flip) algorithm to solve an Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation of resistive and viscous magnetohydrodynamics equations. {\{}{\textless}{\}}BR /{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} Results: The initial force-free configuration is observed to undergo a two-stage evolution consisting of an abrupt regime transition from a slow to a fast reconnection process, which leads the system to a final chaotic configuration. Yet the onset of the fast phase is not determined by any anomalous enhancement in the plasma's local resistivity. An asymmetric development of the whole structure is observed and the related magnetic field topology and energetic features are described. {\{}{\textless}{\}}BR /{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} Conclusions: This mechanism can be used as a simple but effective model of several (explosive) processes taking place from the high chromosphere up to the low corona. Our simplified model of the solar atmosphere allows us to obtain a realistic oriented path for the evolution of the overall flow and reconnecting current-sheet. In the present work, the numerical experiment provides key information and observables (like the energetic fluxes) to be compared with observations.},

abstract = {One of the major problems facing risk assessment at polluted industrial sites and military bases is subsurface contamination by non-aq. phase-liqs. (NAPLs), since tracing the extent of a NAPL plume using conventional methods (drive point profiling) is usually assocd. with difficulties. In an effort to trace subsurface contamination as precisely as possible, monitoring points are placed in the area that might be affected by contaminants, and groundwater and soil samples are taken to the lab. for anal. However, the final no. of monitoring points is hardly ever sufficient for distinctive contamination mapping, and this may ultimately result in an unsuitable remediation action being taken. To obtain a more detailed image of a subsurface NAPL plume and, hence, to facilitate remediation measures that are best suited for the site in question, a denser network of monitoring points is desirable. The aim of the investigation described in this paper was therefore to develop a new detection method for subsurface NAPL contamination, which is based on an easily accessible indicator for NAPLs rather than on the anal. of soil and groundwater samples taken at the site. Based on the good soly. of radon in NAPLs, the idea was put forward that subsurface NAPL contamination should have an influence on the natural radon concn. of the soil gas. Provided this effect is significant, it would be possible to carry out a straightforward radon survey on an appropriate sampling grid covering the suspected site and thus enabling the NAPL contamination to be detected by the localization of anomalous low radon concns. in the soil. The overall aim of the investigation was to assess the general suitability of the soil-gas radon concn. as an indirect tracer for NAPL contamination in the ground. The partitioning coeff. KNAPL/air is one of the most influential parameters governing the decrease of the radon concn. in the soil gas in the presence of a subsurface NAPL contamination. Since NAPL mixts. such as gasoline, diesel fuel and paraffin are among the most important NAPLs regarding remediation activities, lab. expts. were performed to det. the radon-partitioning coeff. for these three NAPL mixts. Field expts. were carried out as well. For the field expts., each site was covered with a suitable grid of soil gas sampling points and the results were compared to the resp. findings of the earlier research performed by conventional means. The partitioning coeffs. achieved correspond to those published for pure NAPLs (Clever 1979) and are thus in the expected range. The results of the field expts. showed that the min. radon concns. detected match the resp. NAPL plumes traced previously. Both the results of the lab expts. and the on-site findings demonstrate that the soil-gas radon concn. can be used as an indicator for subsurface NAPL contamination. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {This paper provides absorbed doses arising from radon gas in air retained in lung airway lumens. Because radon gas exposure experiments often use small animals, the calculation was performed for mice and rats. For reference, the corresponding computations were also done for humans. Assuming that radon concentration in airway lumens is the same as that in the environment, its progeny's production in and clearance from airways were simulated. Absorbed dose rates were obtained for three lung regions and the whole lung, considering that secretory and basal cells are sensitive to radiation. The results showed that absorbed dose rates for all lung regions and whole lung generally increase from mice to rats to humans. For example, the dose rates for the whole lung were 25.4 in mice, 41.7 in rats, and 59.9 pGy (Bq m-3)-1 h -1 in humans. Furthermore, these values were also compared with lung dose rates from two other types of exposures, that is, due to inhalation of radon or its progeny, which were already reported. It was confirmed that the direct inhalation of radon progeny in the natural environment, which is known as a cause of lung cancer, results in the highest dose rates for all species. Based on the present calculations, absorbed dose rates of the whole lung from radon gas were lower by a factor of about 550 (mice), 200 (rats), or 70 (humans) than those from radon progeny inhalation. The calculated dose rate values are comparatively small. Nevertheless, the present study is considered to contribute to our understanding of doses from inhalation of radon and its progeny. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Airborne data are compared statistically with in-house radon measurements in conjunction with geological and ground permeability data to establish linear regression models and produce radon potential maps. The best agreement between the percentage of dwellings exceeding the reference level (RL) for radon concentrations in Ireland ({\%} {\textgreater} RL), estimated from indoor radon data, and modelled RP in the Tralee–Castleisland area is produced using models based on airborne gamma-ray spectrometry equivalent uranium (eU) and ground permeability data.

In both areas, RP maps derived from eU data are spatially more detailed than the published 10 km grid map. The results show the potential for using airborne radiometric data for producing RP maps.},

abstract = {A map of uranium concentration in soil has been planned for the European Atlas of Natural Radiation. This Atlas is being developed by the Radioactivity Environmental Monitoring (REM) group of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. The great interest in uranium compared to other terrestrial radionuclides stems from the fact that radon ((222)Rn) is in the decay chain of uranium ((238)U) and that public exposure to natural ionizing radiation is largely due to indoor radon. With several different databases available, including data (albeit not calibrated) from an airborne survey, Belgium is a favourable case for exploring the methodology of uranium mapping. A harmonized database of uranium in soil was built by merging radiological (not airborne) and geochemical data. Using this harmonized database it was possible to calibrate the data from the airborne survey. Several methods were used to perform spatial interpolation and to smooth the data: moving average without constraint, by soil class and by geological unit. When using the harmonized database, it is first necessary to evaluate the uranium concentration in areas without data or with an insufficient number of data points. Overall, there is a reasonable agreement between the maps on a 1 km × 1 km grid obtained with the two datasets (airborne U and harmonized soil U) with all the methods. The agreement is better when the maps are reduced to a 10 km × 10 km grid; the latter could be used for the European map of uranium concentration in soil.},

The environmental risks of metals, evaluated by sediment quality guidelines and background values, revealed Hg contamination in the estuaries. However, levels of Cd in estuarine sediments were low, and they were less than those levels in river sediments, partly due to the high mobility and dilution of river or seawater. Cd did not contribute to sediment deposits in estuaries. High organic matter from effluents from large municipal sewage treatment plants was predominantly responsible for restricting Hg mobility from the river to Bohai Bay. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) are gaining considerable interest as a geolocation tool and are now widely applied in archaeology, ecology, and forensic research. However, their application for provenance requires the development of baseline models predicting surficial 87Sr/86Sr variations (“isoscapes”). A variety of empirically-based and process-based models have been proposed to build terrestrial 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes but, in their current forms, those models are not mature enough to be integrated with continuous-probability surface models used in geographic assignment. In this study, we aim to overcome those limitations and to predict 87Sr/86Sr variations across Western Europe by combining process-based models and a series of remote-sensing geospatial products into a regression framework. We find that random forest regression significantly outperforms other commonly used regression and interpolation methods, and efficiently predicts the multi-scale patterning of 87Sr/86Sr variations by accounting for geological, geomorphological and atmospheric controls. Random forest regression also provides an easily interpretable and flexible framework to integrate different types of environmental auxiliary variables required to model the multi-scale patterning of 87Sr/86Sr variability. The method is transferable to different scales and resolutions and can be applied to the large collection of geospatial data available at local and global levels. The isoscape generated in this study provides the most accurate 87Sr/86Sr predictions in bioavailable strontium for Western Europe (R2 = 0.58 and RMSE = 0.0023) to date, as well as a conservative estimate of spatial uncertainty by applying quantile regression forest. We anticipate that the method presented in this study combined with the growing numbers of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data and satellite geospatial products will extend the applicability of the 87Sr/86Sr geo-profiling tool in provenance applications.},

The problem with slow pulses due to the long collection times of the ions has been solved with a combination of a specially designed electrode structure and pulse-shaping electronics optimized for highest energy resolution and count rate. An energy resolution of 0.25 MeV FWHM has been achieved for the peaks associated with the alpha decay of radon and its daughters. This makes it possible e.g. to observe thoron (220Rn) in the presence of radon (222Rn). The instrument is portable and has a sensitivity of 1 cpm for a concentration of about 50 Bq/m3 (1.4 pCi/l). ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Geochemical mapping requires a good understanding of geochemical variables and proper use of mathematical and mapping techniques. In this study, GIS mapping for the geochemical variables in Irish soils was achieved using trans-Gaussian kriging following investigation of probability features, outlier identification, optimal power transformation by the Box-Cox method and spatial structure modelling. Relatively high nugget effect values for the variogram models were observed for most variables. The assumption of spatial autocorrelation was seriously breached by two variables, available P and available K, and spatial interpolation was not performed for these. Two or even three nested theoretical models were needed to model variogram structures for most variables reflecting their variation at different spatial scales. The spatial distribution patterns for most elements illustrated the influences of underlying bedrock and soil type, while some of the heavy metals (e.g. Pb, Zn and Cu) were also affected by mining activities and urban sprawl. The available nutrients (P, K and Mg) appeared to be most affected by agricultural activities.},

It is ubiquitous hazard to human health, concentrated in certain geological settings and further intensified by certain home-construction practices. Radon also acts usefully as a tracer for minerals, underground fluid flow, and stresses within the earth. Track methods of radon and radon-daughter measurements are surveyed. Applications are given to measurements of both indoor and outdoor radon for health physics, and an approach is noted to the knotty problems of retrospective studies of individual exposures. Numerous results show evidence of fluid flow through pore spaces in the ground. This flow transports radon and leads to other applications, such as locating subsurface uranium ore, and oil and natural gas deposits. Examples of premonitory radon signals from seismic events are also given.},

Climate anomalies can further increase levels of habitat disturbance and act synergistically to elevate invasion risk. Herein, we use a historical data set from the upper San Francisco Estuary to provide the first empirical evidence for facilitation of invasions by climate extremes. Invasive zooplankton species did not become established in this estuary until the 1970s when increasing propagule pressure from Asia coincided with extended drought periods. Hydrological management exacerbated the effects of post-1960 droughts and reduced freshwater inflow even further, increasing drought severity and allowing unusually extreme salinity intrusions. Native zooplankton experienced unprecedented conditions of high salinity and intensified benthic grazing, and life history attributes of invasive zooplankton were advantageous enough during droughts to outcompete native species and colonise the system. Extreme climatic events can therefore act synergistically with environmental perturbation to facilitate the establishment of invasive species.},

abstract = {Natural analogs offer a valuable opportunity to investigate the long-term impacts associated with the potential leakage in geological storage of CO2. Degassing of CO2 and radon isotopes (222Rn–220Rn) from soil, gas vents and thermal water discharges was investigated in the natural analog of Campo de Calatrava Volcanic Field (CCVF; Central Spain) to determine the CO2–Rn relationships and to assess the role of CO2 as carrier gas for radon. Furthermore, radon measurements to discriminate between shallow and deep gas sources were evaluated under the perspective of their applicability in monitoring programs of carbon storage projects. CO2 flux as high as 5000 g m−2 d−1 and 222Rn activities up to 430 kBq m−3 were measured; 220Rn activi- ties were one order of magnitude lower than those of 222Rn. The 222Rn/220Rn ratios were used to constrain the source of the Campo de Calatrava soil gases since a positive correlation between radon isotopic ratios and CO2 fluxes was observed. Thus, in agreement with previous studies, our results indicate a deep mantle-related origin of CO2 for both free and soil gases, suggesting that carbon dioxide is an efficient carrier for Rn. Furthermore, it was ascertained that the increase of 222Rn in the soil gases was likely pro- duced by two main processes: (i) direct transport by a carrier gas, i.e., CO2 and (ii) generation at shallow level due to the presence of relatively high concentrations of dissolved U and Ra in the thermal aquifer of Campo de Calatrava. The diffuse CO2 soil flux and radon isotopic surveys carried out in the Campo de Calatrava Volcanic Fields can also be applicable to geochemical monitoring programs in CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) areas as these parameters are useful to: (i) constrain CO2 leakages once detected and (ii) monitor both the evolution of the leakages and the effectiveness of subsequent remediation activities.

@article{Dauvin2009,
abstract = {The implementation of the European Water Framework Directive has provoked enthusiastic debate between scientists and stakeholders, as they try to define the ecological quality status (EcoQS) of all water bodies, including estuaries (i.e., transitional waters). The issue is complex because estuarine environments are variable, due to fresh and marine water input and anthropogenic impacts. Benthic species and communities have adapted to tolerate temporal physico-chemical changes (e.g., salinity, substrata, depth, fine particles and a Maximum Turbidity Zone that is rich in organic matter). However, anthropogenization affects not only the water quality, but also estuarine surface size and navigation channel management. Though numerous bio-indicators and indices are used to define estuarine system EcoQS, very few of them were developed specifically for such variable anthropogenized systems comprising a variety of conditions. The critical question is: 'Is it possible to define an EcoQS for such specific modified and naturally stressed ecosystems?' Indicators must be chosen pragmatically so that they will be environmentally sustainable, economically viable, technologically feasible, socially desirable/tolerable, legally permissible and politically expedient. This contribution proposes an adaptation of the BOPA index, the Benthic Opportunistic Annelida Amphipod index (BO2 A), for use in the freshwater zones of transitional waters (i.e., up to the upper limit of tidal range). Several possibilities are discussed in light of the diverse disturbances and the heterogeneity of such stressed zones. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Heavy metal toxicity has become a global concern due to the ever-increasing contamination of soil, water and crops. Until recent decades little has been known about the remediation of mining sites using spontaneous plants in Latin America. Soil and plant samples were taken in Peru, at a polymetallic mine (mainly silver, lead and copper) in Cajamarca Province, Hualgayoc district. Top soils (0-20cm) were analyzed for physical and chemical properties by standard methods. Total Pb and Zn concentrations in top soils were determined by ICP-OES. Similar metals in plants were analyzed separately (aerial and root system). Ti content was used as an indicator for contamination of plant samples with soil particles. Translocation Factor (TF) and Shoot Accumulation Factor (SAF) were determined to assess the tolerance strategies developed by these species and to evaluate their potential for phytoremediation purposes. The non polluted soils had near neutral pH (6.8??0.1), a great content of organic carbon (42??4.0gkg-1) and a silt loamy texture. According to the total metal concentrations, the polluted soils exceeded toxicity thresholds; large Pb (13,105??3147mgPbkg-1) and Zn (28,393??3458mgZnkg-1) concentrations were detected. Unusually elevated concentrations of these metals were detected in roots of Bidens triplinervia L. (e.g. up to 5180mgPbkg-1 and 9900mgZnkg-1) while Senecio sp. accumulated more heavy metals in shoots (e.g. up to 4250mgPbkg-1 and 3870mgZnkg-1). The TF values were {\textless}1 in B. triplinervia and {\textgreater}1 in Senecio sp., while the SAF were {\textless}1 in both species collected in contaminated soils. B. triplinervia can be considered potentially useful for phytostabilization due to its capacity to restrict the accumulation of elevated amounts of Pb and Zn to the roots, while Senecio sp. could be utilized for phytoextraction technologies. Moreover, these plants showed an elevated transfer factor and grew in the presence of other toxic metals. The present study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report on the metal accumulation in roots of B. triplinervia and provides a pioneer contribution to the very small volume of data available on the potential use of native plant species from contaminated sites in phytostabilization and phytoremediation technologies. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ordinary kriging is well-known to be optimal when the data have a multivariate normal distribution (and if the variogram is known), whereas lognormal kriging presupposes the multivariate lognormality of the data. But in practice, real data never entirely satisfy these assumptions. In this article, the sensitivity of these two kriging estimators to departures from these assumptions and in particular, their resistance to outliers is considered. An outlier effect index designed to assess the effect of a single outlier on both estimators is proposed, which can be extended to other types of estimators. Although lognormal kriging is sensitive to slight variations in the sill of the variogram of the logs (i.e., their variance), it is not influenced by the estimate of the mean of the logs.},

abstract = {CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is likely to become a necessary option in mitigating global climate change. However, lack of detailed knowledge on potential deep geological reservoirs can hamper the development of CCS. In this paper a new methodology is presented to assess and create exploration priority lists for poorly known reservoirs. Geological expert judgements are used as a basis in a two-stage geo-techno-economic approach, where first an estimate of the practical reservoir capacity is calculated, and secondly source-sink matching is used for calculating an estimate of the matched capacity and the reservoir development probability. This approach is applied to Belgium, demonstrating how a priority ranking for reservoirs can be obtained based on limited available data and large uncertainties. The results show the Neeroeteren Formation as the most prospective reservoir, followed by the Buntsandstein Formation and the Dinantian reservoirs. The findings indicate that CO2 export to reservoirs in neighbouring countries seems inevitable; still, there is a 70{\%} chance storage will happen in Belgian reservoirs, with an average matched capacity estimate of 110Mt CO2. These quantitative results confirm the qualitative resource pyramid classification of potential reservoirs. For Belgium, a high economic risk is attached to reservoir exploration and development. Exploration remains however a necessity if CCS is to be deployed. Furthermore, it is shown that the presented methodology is indeed capable of producing realistic results, and that using expert judgements for reservoir assessments is valid and beneficial. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The impact of climate change on migration has gained both academic and public interest in recent years. Here we employ a meta-analysis approach to synthesize the evidence from 30 country-level studies that estimate the effect of slow- and rapid-onset events on migration worldwide. Most studies find that environmental hazards affect migration, although with contextual variation. Migration is primarily internal or to low- and middle-income countries. The strongest relationship is found in studies with a large share of countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, particularly from Latin America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa, and in studies of middle-income and agriculturally dependent countries. Income and conflict moderate and partly explain the relationship between environmental change and migration. Combining our estimates for differential migration responses with the observed environmental change in these countries in recent decades illustrates how the meta-analytic results can provide useful insights for the identification of potential hotspots of environmental migration.},

The aim of present survey was focused on determining the current radon exhalation rate and radium concentration in soil samples collected from some areas of the Ganderbal district, Jammu and Kashmir, India. “Can technique” has been employed for the measurement of radon exhalation rate and radium concentration in soil samples collected from under study areas. The Uranium concentration in these soil samples where estimated by using the fission track registration technique (using LR-115 plastic track detectors).The uranium concentration was found to varies between 2.03 and 3.52 ppm. The radon exhalation rate in these samples has been found to vary from 5.05 to 21.89 m Bq kg−1 h−1. Radium concentration in soil samples varies from 6.43 to 18.89 Bq kg−1. The calculated values of Uranium concentration in these soil/rock samples are quite lower than the risk level. Radon and radium values found in these samples are also lower than that of optimum value. Hence these areas can be considered as risk free zones from human health point of view.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new methodological approach for modeling continuous point-generating pro- cesses leading to spatial point patterns. It explores the theoretical foundation and potential applications for copula models in spatial sciences. A copula is a function that combines univariate distributions to obtain a joint distribution with a particular dependence structure. The method is flexible because it separates the choice of dependence among variables from the choice of the marginal distributions of each variable. In addition, copulas are powerful because they are able to capture dependence structures in extreme distributions and in the tails of a distribution. Copula techniques are well established in both financial econometrics and actuarial science, yet the potential of copulas in the context of spatial sciences is relatively unexplored. The study includes an application of spatial copulas to model housing values in an urban area, using complex components such as distance decay, directionality, and edge effects.

Current functionalities of metagear include the following: an abstract screener GUI to efficiently sieve bibliographic information from large numbers of candidate studies; tools to assign screening effort across multiple collaborators/reviewers and to assess inter-reviewer reliability using kappa statistics; PDF downloader to automate the retrieval of journal articles from online data bases; automated data extractions from scatter-plots, box-plots and bar-plots; PRISMA flow diagrams; simple imputation tools to fill gaps in incomplete or missing study parameters; generation of random-effects sizes for Hedges' d, log response ratio, odds ratio and correlation coefficients for Monte Carlo experiments; covariance equations for modelling dependencies among multiple effect sizes (e.g. with a common control, phylogenetic correlations); and finally, summaries that replicate analyses and outputs from widely used but no longer updated meta-analysis software.

However, the interpretation of anomalies in surficial gases can be difficult because soil-gas concentrations are dependent on both meteorological and environmental conditions. For this study, concentrations of He, CO2, O2and N2and meteorological conditions were monitored for 10-14 months at eight nonmineralized sites in both humid and dry environments. Gases were collected at 0.6-0.7-m depth at seven sites. At one site, gases were collected from 0.3-, 0.6-, 1.2-, and 2.0-m depths; diurnal monitoring studies were conducted at this site also. Rain and snowfall, soil and air temperatures, barometric pressure, and relative humidity were monitored at all the sites. The sand, silt and clay content, and the organic carbon content of surficial soil were measured at each site. Meteorological conditions generally affected He and CO2concentrations in the same way at all the sites; however, these effects were modified by local environmental conditions. Both seasonal and diurnal concentration changes occurred. The most important seasonal concentration changes were related to rain and snowfall and soil and air temperatures. Seasonal changes tended to be larger then the diurnal changes, but both could be related to the same processes. Local conditions of soil type and organic content affected the amount of pore space and moisture present in the soil and therefore the soil-gas concentrations. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

By the end of 2007, approximately 15 Mt of CO2 had been successfully injected into saline aquifers by these operations. However, these projects are not necessarily representative of conditions encountered globally.

Radioactivity as measured on these complex systems is consequently perturbed by several mixed effects. In order to find out a possible (potential) relationship among soil properties and experimental data attributable to radioactivities of K, Th, U and Rn a detailed investigation has been performed in the Cecita Lake basin (Sila Grande, Calabria, Southern Italy). Most of the soil types outcropping in the Cecita Lake surroundings belong to the Entisol and Inceptisol orders [USDA (United States Department of Agriculture), 2006.

Disintegrations contributed by K, Th, U and Rn measured respectively in {\%} (K), ppm (U and Th) and kBq/m3 (Rn), have been related to 13 a priori known soil unit groups with well-defined general features and spatial position. The data have been analysed by using graphical and numerical statistical procedures able to manage compositional data in a correct sample space. The paper summarises the results of this research and highlights the conclusions drawn from these investigations, particularly concerning i) the modelling of the high U variability, a behaviour that tends to homogenise the differences potentially attributable to soil features, with the exception of situations where uranium could be enriched due to adsorption onto iron oxi-hydroxides and/or clay minerals or concentrated in argillic horizons due to illuviation; ii) the discovering of the discriminative effect of the K/Th ratio values, particularly for soil groups where Th behaviour, as other tetravalent actinides, is strongly affected by the presence of mineral colloids or where the presence of clays affects the trapping of K; iii) the clustering of the a priori known soil groups in four new sets characterised by internal similarities for Rn values for which the morphology appears to be the most important discriminative effect. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Casta{\~{n}}ar cave contains the highest radon gas ((222)Rn) concentration in Spain with an annual average of 31.9 kBq m(-)(3). Seasonal variations with summer minimums and maximum values in fall were recorded. The reduction of air-filled porosity of soil and rock by condensation or rainfalls hides the radon exchange by gas diffusion, determining this seasonal stair-step pattern of the radon activity concentration in underground air. The effective total dose and the maximum hours permitted have been evaluated for the guides and public safety with a highly detailed radon measurement along 2011 and 2012. A network of 12 passive detectors (kodalphas) has been installed, as well as, two radon continuous monitoring in the most interesting geological sites of the subterranean environment. A follow up of the recommended time (max. 50 min) inside the underground environment has been analysed since the reopen to public visitors for not surpassing the legal maximum effective dose for tourists and guides. Results shown that public visitors would receive in fall a 12.1{\%} of the total effective dose permitted per visit, whereas in summer it is reduced to 8.6{\%}, while the cave guide received a total effective dose of 6.41 mSv in four months. The spatial radon maps allow defining the most suitable touristic paths according to the radon concentration distribution and therefore, appropriate fall and summer touristic paths are recommended.},

abstract = {A total of 74 samples of soil, sediment, industrial sludge, and surface water were collected in a Mediterranean estuarine system in order to assess the potential ecological impact of elevated concentrations of Co and Mn associated with a Terephthalic (PTA) and Isophthalic (PIPA) acids production plant. Samples were analyzed for elemental composition (37 elements), pH, redox potential, organic carbon, and CaCO3 content, and a group of 16 selected samples were additionally subjected to a Tessier sequential extraction. Co and Mn soil concentrations were significantly higher inside the industrial facility and around its perimeter than in background samples, and maximum dissolved Co and Mn concentrations were found in a creek near the plant's discharge point, reaching values 17,700 and 156 times higher than their respective background concentrations. The ecological risk was evaluated as a function of Co and Mn fractionation and bioavailability which were controlled by the environmental conditions generated by the advance of seawater into the estuarine system during high tide. Co appeared to precipitate near the river mouth due to the pH increase produced by the influence of seawater intrusion, reaching hazardous concentrations in sediments. In terms of their bioavailability and the corresponding risk assessment code, both Co and Mn present sediment concentrations that result in medium to high ecological risk whereas water concentrations of both elements reach values that more than double their corresponding Secondary Acute Values.},

abstract = {This study presents an overview of some results obtained within the French ANR (National Agency of Research) supported G{\'{e}}ocarbone-Monitoring research program. The measurements were performed in Sainte-Marguerite, located in the French Massif Central. This site represents a natural laboratory for CO2/fluid/rock interactions studies, as well as CO2 migration mechanisms towards the surface. The CO2 leaking character of the studied area also allows to test and validate measurements methods and verifications for the future CO2 geological storage sites. During these surveys, we analyzed soil CO2 fluxes and concentrations. We sampled and analyzed soil gases, and gas from carbo-gaseous bubbling springs. A one-month continuous monitoring was also tested, to record the concentration of CO2 both in atmosphere and in the soil at a single point. We also developed a new methodology to collect soil gas samples for noble gas abundances and isotopic analyses, as well as carbon isotopic ratios. Our geochemical results, combined with structural geology, show that the leaking CO2 has a very deep origin, partially mantle derived. The gas rises rapidly along normal and strike-slip active faults. CO2 soil concentrations (also showing a mantle derived component) and CO2 fluxes are spatially variable, and reach high values. The recorded atmospheric CO2 is not very high, despite the important CO2 degassing throughout the whole area.},

abstract = {In Earth Sciences there is a growing interest in studies concerning soil-radon activity, due to its potential as a tracer of numerous natural phenomena. Our work marks an advance in the comprehension of the interplay between tectonic activity, volcanic eruptions and gas release through faults. Soil-radon measurements, acquired on Mt. Etna volcano in 2009-2011, were analyzed. Our radon probe is sensitive to changes in both volcanic and seismic activity. Radon data were reviewed in light of the meteorological parameters. Soil samples were analyzed to characterize their uranium content. All data have been summarized in a physical model which identifies the radon sources, highlights the mechanism of radon transport and envisages how such a mechanism may change as a consequence of seismicity and volcanic events. In the NE of Etna, radon is released mainly from a depth of {\textless}1400 m, with an ascent speed of {\textgreater}50 m/day. Three periods of anomalous gas release were found (February 2010, January and February 2011). The trigger of the first anomaly was tectonic, while the second and third had a volcanic origin. These results mark a significant step towards a better understanding of the endogenous mechanisms that cause changes in soil-radon emission at active volcanoes.},

abstract = {The isotope composition of He and its relationship to CO2 have been investigated in gases sampled on 12 active volcanoes of Japan. The highest 3He4He ratios reach the lower limit of the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) range and have been recorded at Kusatsu-Shirane Volcano, which presented a phreatic activity during the sampling period, and at Satsuma-Iojima Volcano, where the highest temperature (786°C) was recorded. 3He4He variations (3.1{\textperiodcentered}10-6-9.8{\textperiodcentered}10-6) suggest that, although 3He comes from the upper mantle, part of 4He is released from the crust in the volcano area. Time elapsed after volcanic events and distance from volcanics centers appear the major factors controlling these variations. CO23He molar ratios (4.5{\textperiodcentered}109-29{\textperiodcentered}109) are systematically higher than the MORB average of 2{\textperiodcentered}109. The apparent excess of CO2 (relative to 3He) cannot be entirely due to physical or chemical fractionation during the transfer of gases from the magmatic source to the surface. It is attributed to the effect of crustal outgassing or the contribution of a few percent of subducted sediments to the source of arc magmas. The last figure is in agreement with other geochemical tracers (Nd, Sr and pb isotopes, rare earth elements, 10Be, etc.). The estimated CO2 flux at arcs is in the order of (1-5){\textperiodcentered}1011 mol yr.-1 and represents {\textless}20{\%} of the carbon flux at ridges. A mass balance of carbon at arcs shows that most sedimentary carbonates must be accreted rather than subducted. The flux of 3He at arc volcanoes represents {\textless}13{\%} of the total volcanic 3He flux. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Identifying the local interactions between housing prices and population migration is complicated by their simultaneous and spatially interdependent relationship. Higher housing prices may repel households and push them into neighboring areas, suggesting that separately identifying interactions within versus across local neighborhoods is important. Aggregate data and standard econometric models are unable to address the multiple identification problems that may arise from the simultaneity, spatial interaction, and unobserved spatial autocorrelation. Such problems can generate biased estimates that run counter to economic theory. Using Michigan census tract-level data, we estimate a spatial simultaneous equations model that jointly considers population change and housing values, while also explicitly modeling interactions within neighborhoods, spatial interactions across neighborhoods, and controlling for unobserved spatial correlations. After controlling for simultaneity and spatial autocorrelation, the results show that neighborhoods are likely to experience an increase in their housing values if they gain population and they are more likely to lose population if they experience an increase in housing values. Our results are consistent with theory and underscore the importance of accounting for spatial interdependencies between population change and housing values. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

It provides new results about theoretical properties of means and covariance functions for compositional data, with an axiomatic perspective. Original results that shed new light on geostatistical modeling of compositional data are presented. As a first result, it is shown that the weighted arithmetic mean is the only central tendency characteristic satisfying a small set of axioms, namely continuity, reflexivity, and marginal stability. Moreover, this set of axioms also implies that the weights must be identical for all parts of the composition. This result has deep consequences for spatial multivariate covariance modeling of compositional data. In a geostatistical setting, it is shown as a second result that the proportional model of covariance functions (i.e., the product of a covariance matrix and a single correlation function) is the only model that provides identical kriging weights for all components of the compositional data. As a consequence of these two results, the proportional model of covariance function is the only covariance model compatible with reflexivity and marginal stability.},

The radon potential map presented here, produced by mapping radon concentrations in homes, grouped by underlying geology, provides the most detailed and accurate assessment of radon in England. Bedrock and superficial geology associated with the most radon prone areas are investigated using the joint HPA-BGS radon potential dataset, geological information and, where available, soil geochemistry, airborne radiometric or laboratory analysis. Some of the geological units associated with high radon potential are well known, such as the granite intrusions in south west England, the Carboniferous limestones of Derbyshire and the Jurassic ironstones in Northamptonshire. This study provides a more comprehensive description of the main bedrock geological units associated with intermediate to high radon potential in England including: granites and associated uranium mineralisation in south west England; Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian and Jurassic limestones and dolomites; Devonian, Carboniferous, Jurassic and Cretaceous sandstones; Silurian, Devonian, Lower Carboniferous and Jurassic mudstones; Jurassic ironstones; and some Triassic breccias and conglomerates. Uranium in soil is elevated over many known radon-prone areas but also reflects the accumulation of U in organic-rich soil and peat. Near surface weathering, bedrock fracturing and former working of the ironstones in the English Midlands are all implicated in increased radon potential on these geological units.},

Results on the radioactive secular equilibrium of both (238)U and (232)Th radioactive series are presented by studying the (226)Ra/(238)U and (228)Ra/(228)Th ratios. The majority of the samples are in radioactive secular equilibrium for (226)Ra/(238)U ± 1$\sigma$. However, several samples exhibit (226)Ra/(238)U ratios significantly different from 1. The distortion of the secular equilibrium in the (226)Ra-(238)U isotopic system of those samples has occurred over the last 1 Ma, and can be associated with post-magmatic processes, mainly rock-water interactions. All studied samples have (228)Ra/(228)Th ratios equal to unity ±1$\sigma$. Consequently, they can be considered to be in secular equilibrium for the last 40 a.},

abstract = {Precursory geochemical signatures of radon degassing in the subsurface of the Tenerife Island were observed several months prior to the recent 2004 seismic-volcanic crisis. These premonitory signatures were detected by means of a continuous monitoring of 222Rn and 220Rn activity from a bubbling CO2-rich gas spot located at 2.850 m depth inside a horizontal gallery for groundwater exploitation at Tenerife. Multivariate Regression Analysis (MRA) on time series of the radon activity was applied to eliminate the radon activity fluctuation due to external variables such as barometric pressure, temperature and relative humidity as well as power supply. Material Failure Forecast Method (FFM) was successfully applied to forecast the anomalous seismicity registered in Tenerife Island in 2004. The changes in the 222Rn/220Rn ratio observed after the period of anomalous seismicity might suggest a higher gas flow rate and/or changes in the vertical permeability induced by seismic activity.},

abstract = {The geological record bears evidence of various periods of wide-scale oceanic anoxia that are associated with perturbations of the marine carbon and phosphorus (P) cycles. In this study, we examine the impact of changes in bottom water oxygen and organic matter (OM) input on burial of P in deep-sea sediments using a reactive-transport model. Results show that the burial of key reactive P phases, namely authigenic calcium associated P minerals (Ca-P), organic P (org P) and iron-bound P (Fe-P), responds non-linearly to both water column forcings, namely water column oxygenation and OM loading. High organic matter (OM) flux with either very low or high oxygen ({\~{}}. 180. $\mu$M) favor the formation of authigenic Ca-P, while low oxygen and intermediate to high OM fluxes promote org P burial. Iron-bound P is only preserved in the sediment when oxygen levels are high and OM fluxes low. The conditions for maximum P recycling (or minimum P burial) are low bottom water oxygen concentrations and low OM fluxes to the sediment-water interface (hypoxic, oligotrophic deep-sea settings). The bivariate dependence of P burial on oxygen and OM flux was implemented in an existing box model of the global marine P, oxygen and organic carbon cycles, replacing simple empirical redox functions for P burial. The response of the original and new box model to decreased ocean mixing was then assessed, in the context of a long-term response. In the new model, org P instead of authigenic Ca-P is the dominant burial phase of P in deep-sea environments during periods of oceanic anoxia. Nevertheless, reduced ocean mixing leads to a similar response in total P burial and, as a consequence, to a similar increase in deep water anoxia and decrease in open ocean productivity whether an empirical or mechanistic description of phosphorus diagenesis is considered. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Tests show the method provides reliable results, comparable with those of established on-site analysis methods.

Erebus plume was measured by in-plume infrared analysis during December 1997, December 1999 and January 2001. The CO2 emission rates were consistently close to the average of 22.3 kg/s (1930 Mg/day) for the three measurements conducted over a 4-year period even though the third measurement (January 2001) was conducted at a time of elevated activity. As CO2 is considered a good indicator of eruptive activity a more frequent type of monitoring system may be necessary to detect changes related to activity at Mt. Erebus. Increased CO2 emissions lost via Strombolian eruptions in the lava lake were not accounted for in our airborne measurements. Carbon monoxide flux, determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in December 1995, yielded a rate of 1.74 kg/s (150 Mg/day) and a high CO:CO2 ratio of 0.12. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In most cases, CO2 captured from power plants or large industrial sources contains impurities. As purification of the stream is energy and cost intensive it is necessary to allow a certain level of impurities. The effects of impurities on (short- and long-term) geological storage are, however, uncertain. In this work, geochemical modelling with PHREEQC is performed to describe such effects on a sandstone reservoir (depleted gas field). The impact of two possible CO2 streams, originating from pre-combustion and oxyfuel capture technology is investigated. The streams contain O2, H2, CO, H2S, SO2, and/or NO as potential chemically reactive components. H2S, SO2 and NO are computed to oxidize, thereby forming sulfuric or nitric acid, and decrease the pH of the formation water. A low pH of the brine may be the result of extensive dissolution and dissociation, and therefore accumulation in the brine phase, especially close to the injection well. The impact of impurities on fast reacting minerals (short-term effects) is predicted to be relatively insignificant, due to the low amount of brine generally present in a gas field. On the long-term (equilibrium stage), impurities cause a slightly different mineralogy compared to pure CO2 injection. For the latter case a final increase in porosity of 3.5{\%} is predicted whilst impurities (especially oxygen) could mitigate the porosity increase to zero due to the precipitation of minerals with higher molar volumes, like alunite and nontronite. Overall, the impurities do not seem to have a significant impact on the reservoir, even if accumulation in the brine takes place. The possible limiting effect of diffusion of impurities within the supercritical CO2 towards the brine has not been taken into account, even though the effect could be relevant. It could delay the effect of the impurities due to retarded dissolution. Further research should focus on this issue. Also the spatial effects and effects on different reservoir types, cap rock and well cement need to be investigated. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A radon survey was carried out at an abandoned military airfield, heavily contaminated with non-aqueous phase-liquids (NAPLs). Geo-statistical analysis of the data was used to confirm the validity of the chosen soil gas sampling pattern. The survey revealed a non-uniform distribution of the soil gas radon concentration in the upper soil in spite of a virtually homogenous geological situation. The radon distribution pattern showed minimum zones with radon concentrations decreased by up to 90{\%} with regard to the local background level. The determined radon minimum anomalies could be explicitly associated with the NAPL subsurface contamination. The observed effect is due to the strong partitioning of radon into NAPLs from soil gas or groundwater. Corresponding partitioning coefficients were determined in the laboratory for some NAPL. As result of the study, it was shown that naturally occurring soil gas radon has the potential to be used as an indicator for the localization of subsurface NAPL contamination. As possible options for survey equipment, the AlphaGUARD radon monitor and passive solid-state nuclear track detectors were successfully evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Monoterpene emissions from Scots pine have traditionally been assumed to originate as evaporation from specialized storage pools. More recently, the signiﬁcance of de novo emissions, originating directly from monoterpene biosynthesis, has been recognized. To study the role of biosynthesis in the ecosystem scale, we measured monoterpene emissions from a Scots pine dominated forest in southern Finland using the disjunct eddy covariance method combined with proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry. The interpretation of the measurements was based on a hybrid emission algorithm describing both de novo and pool emissions. During the measurement period May– August 2007, the monthly medians of daytime emissions were 170, 280, 180, and 180 g m2 h 1 The emission . potential for both de novo and pool emissions exhibited a decreasing summertime trend. The ratio of the de novo emission potential to the total emission potential varied between 30{\%} and 46{\%}. Although the monthly changes were not signiﬁcant, the ratio always differed statistically from zero, i.e. the role of de novo biosynthesis was evident. The hybrid approach showed promising potential for the improvement of the ecosystem scale emission modelling. Given this feature and the signiﬁcant role of biosynthesis, we recommend incorporating both de novo and pool emissions into the monoterpene emission algorithms for Scots pine dominated forests},

abstract = {With increasingly high housing prices, the urban housing problem has changed from an economic issue to a livelihood issue in China. Taking 32 major cities in China as an example, this paper employed data from 2007 to 2016 to build a panel data model to empirically study the impact of population migration on urban housing prices. From the two perspectives of the national level and regional level (eastern region, central region and western region), the results of this study showed that (1) on the national level, population inflow had a significant positive correlation with urban housing prices, where a population inflow rate increase of 1{\%} increased urban housing prices by 0.31{\%}; and (2) on the regional level, a population inflow rate increase of 1{\%} increased urban housing prices in the eastern region by 1.34{\%}, but population inflow had no obvious impact on the urban housing prices in the central and western regions. Based on the results, this study suggested addressing housing supply imbalances through housing product diversification and affordable housing system improvement, and addressing construction land supply imbalances by building a perfect system linking land-use planning to population; at the same time, it also suggested building more nationally central cities following the urbanization trend, and taking this as the key to developing urban agglomerations, reasonably decentralizing the population flow, promoting the healthy and stable development of the real-estate market and advancing sustainable urbanization. The above conclusions have practical significance for China and other developing countries to coordinate population and urban development in the process of rapid urbanization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Radon is the second most important cause of lung cancer, ranked by the World Health Organization as the fifth leading cause of mor-tality in 2010. An updated database of national radon exposures for 66 countries allows the global burden of lung cancer mortality attributable to ra-don to be estimated. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to estimate the global population attributable burden of lung cancer mortality in 2012 from residential radon. METHODS: Estimates of the population attributable risk (PAR) of lung cancer mortality from radon were determined using the attributable fraction approach, using three models for excess relative risk of lung cancer from radon. RESULTS: The estimates of the median PAR of lung cancer mortality from residential radon in 2012 for the 66 countries having representative national radon surveys were consistent, as 16.5{\%}, 14.4{\%}, and 13.6{\%} for the exposure–age–concentration (EAC) model (BEIR VI), the Hunter model, and the Kreuzer model, respectively. The mean PAR using the EAC model ranged from 4.2{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.9, 11.7) for Japan, to 29.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 22.9, 35.7) for Armenia, with a median for the 66 countries of 16.5{\%}. Radon-attributable lung cancer deaths for all 66 countries totaled 226,057 in 2012 and rep-resent a median of 3.0{\%} of total cancer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent findings between the three models used to estimate excess relative risks of lung cancer from radon, and between the attrib-utable fraction methodology and the life table analysis, confirm that residential radon is responsible for a substantial proportion of lung cancer mortal-ity worldwide.},

abstract = {Two soil gas surveys were performed in 1991 and 1993 over an area of 95�km2 at Pisticci, Southern Italy. The research was aimed at assessing the relationship between soil gas distribution and fracture systems in a Plio-Pleistocene clay basin located in the Bradanic trough. More than 400 samples were collected to measure the He, CO2 and 222Rn concentration in soil atmosphere. Very large helium anomalies ([Delta]He), up to 21[punctuation space]000�ppb above atmospheric reference, were detected in 1991 in correspondence with the youngest fractures reported in the literature. In order to verify the persistence of such soil gas anomalies, a survey was conducted again in 1993 in subareas where major helium anomalies were previously detected. The values of CO2 and 222Rn have shown about the same average as that in the 1991 survey, while [Delta]He values have revealed a sharp decrease with maximum values, not exceeding 3000�ppb. This considerable difference is tentatively related to the seismic activity that occurred just before the 1991 survey, whereas no appreciable seismic activity was reported in 1993. The results of the soil gas surveys show that the shape and spatial distribution of the gas anomalies are related to the structural pattern of the area, whereas the magnitude of gas leakage is controlled by the occurrence of deep gas-bearing traps (hydrocarbon reservoirs) and possibly triggered by seismic activity.},

abstract = {Studies of the potential environmental consequences of carbon capture and storage (CCS) have, to date, focused on the physical and chemical impacts of CO2 within stable geological formations together with associated monitoring systems to assure that no significant leakage occurs. If leakage did occur after formal closure of the injection site, this is likely to be restricted to discrete point sources, such as abandoned wells, resulting in locally high concentrations of CO2 in near-surface ecosystems. Consequently, environmental impacts of localised elevated CO2 on terrestrial and marine ecosystems are areas of active research. However, the CO2 storage site could also impact on the deep subsurface microbial ecosystem and biogeochemical processes. This paper describes short pilot studies (2136 h/ 89 days) investigating the changes in physical transport properties that are mediated by microbial activity, within samples of sandstone under experimental conditions simulating deep aquifer and reservoir environments in the North Sea. They showed, for the first time, that P. aeruginosa and indigenous microbial populations can survive exposure to saline fluids saturated with CO2. However, little impact on fluid transport under these conditions in these short experiments was observed. It is possible that the microbes require a period of acclimatisation to the extreme environmental conditions generated by the presence of CO2 before any impacts can be detected. Thus, long-term experiments are needed to clarify the role of microbes on rock transport properties. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.},

abstract = {Machine learning is a class of statistical techniques which has proven to be a powerful tool for modelling the behaviour of complex systems, in which response quantities depend on assumed controls or predictors in a complicated way. In this paper, as our first purpose, we propose the application of machine learning to reconstruct incomplete or irregularly sampled data of time series indoor radon (222Rn). The physical assumption underlying the modelling is that Rn concentration in the air is controlled by environmental variables such as air temperature and pressure. The algorithms “learn” from complete sections of multivariate series, derive a dependence model and apply it to sections where the controls are available, but not the response (Rn), and in this way complete the Rn series. Three machine learning techniques are applied in this study, namely random forest, its extension called the gradient boosting machine and deep learning. For a comparison, we apply the classical multiple regression in a generalized linear model version. Performance of the models is evaluated through different metrics. The performance of the gradient boosting machine is found to be superior to that of the other techniques. By applying learning machines, we show, as our second purpose, that missing data or periods of Rn series data can be reconstructed and resampled on a regular grid reasonably, if data of appropriate physical controls are available. The techniques also identify to which degree the assumed controls contribute to imputing missing Rn values. Our third purpose, though no less important from the viewpoint of physics, is identifying to which degree physical, in this case environmental variables, are relevant as Rn predictors, or in other words, which predictors explain most of the temporal variability of Rn. We show that variables which contribute most to the Rn series reconstruction, are temperature, relative humidity and day of the year. The first two are physical predictors, while “day of the year” is a statistical proxy or surrogate for missing or unknown predictors.},

Surface samples were taken from 30 locations covering the entire estuary. Grain size and trace element (Ni, Pb, Co, Cu, Zn, Cd, Mn, Fe, Al) variations were analysed, and enrichment factors (EF) as well as geo-accumulation indices (Igeo) calculated to understand the contamination level of the study area. A geographical information system (GIS) mapping technique was employed to highlight the spatial distribution patterns of trace elements in the estuarine sediments. Vulnerability maps prepared from the Igeo values revealed that the estuary is extremely contaminated with Cd and moderately contaminated with Zn and Pb. The sources of these metals are associated with nearby chemical plants and harbour activities. The cumulative effect of anthropogenic activities has led to a serious threat to the whole estuarine environment. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Potassium (K) is a major element for plant growth. The K+ ions fixed in soil 2:1 clay mineral interlayers contribute to plant K nutrition. Such clay minerals are most often the majority in temperate soils. Field and laboratory observations based on X-ray diffraction techniques suggest that 2:1 clay minerals behave as a K reservoir. The present work investigated this idea through data from a replicated long term fertilization experiment which allowed one to address the following questions: (1) Do fertilization treatments induce some modifications (as seen from X-ray diffraction measurements) on soil 2:1 clay mineralogy? (2) Are soil 2:1 clay mineral modifications related to soil K budget in the different plots? (3) Do fertilizer treatments modify clay Al, Si, Mg, Fe or K elemental content? (4) Are clay mineral modifications related to clay K content modifications? (5) Are clay mineral changes related to clay Al, Si, Mg or Fe content as well as those of K content? Our results showed that K fertilization treatments considered in the context of soil K budget are very significantly related to 2:1 soil clay mineralogy and clay K content. The 2:1 clay mineral modifications observed through X-ray measurements were quantitatively correlated with chemically analyzed clay K content. Clay K content modifications are independent from clay Al, Si, Mg or Fe contents. These results show that the soil chemical environment can modify interlayer site occupations (illite content) which suggests that high level accumulation of potassium can occur without any modification of the clay sheet structure. This study therefore validates the view of 2:1 clay minerals as a K reservoir easily quantifiable through X-ray observations.},

Radon ((222)Rn and (220)Rn) concentration measurements in soil gas (using ionization chamber AlphaGUARD PQ2000 PRO and diffusion chambers with CR-39 detectors), as well as radioactive natural isotopes of radium, thorium and potassium in soil samples (using gamma ray spectrometry with NaI(Tl) and HPGe detectors), were performed. Site selection was based on a geological map of Krakow. Geophysical methods (ground penetrating radar and shallow acoustic seismic) were applied to recognize the geological structure of the area and to locate the predicted courses of faults. Elevated levels of radon and thoron in soil gas were found in the study area when compared with those observed in an earlier survey covering Krakow agglomeration. For (222)Rn, the arithmetic mean of registered concentration values was 39 kBq/m(3) (median: 35.5 kBq/m(3)). For (220)Rn, the arithmetic mean was 10.8 kBq/m(3) and median 11.8 kBq/m(3).},

There is a relationship between radioactivity and geology and in the past this relationship has been used to predict geology from an aerial survey. The purpose of this project is to develop a method to predict the radiologic exposure rate of the geologic materials by creating a high resolution background model. The intention is for this method to be used in an emergency response scenario where the background radiation environment is unknown. Two study areas in Southern Nevada have been modeled using geologic data, images from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), geochemical data, and pre-existing low resolution aerial surveys from the National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) Survey. Using these data, geospatial areas that are homogenous in terms of K, U, and Th, referred to as background radiation units, are defined and the gamma ray exposure rate is predicted. The prediction is compared to data collected via detailed aerial survey by the Department of Energy's Remote Sensing Lab - Nellis, allowing for the refinement of the technique. By using geologic units to define radiation background units of exposed bedrock and ASTER visualizations to subdivide and define radiation background units within alluvium, successful models have been produced for Government Wash, north of Lake Mead, and for the western shore of Lake Mohave, east of Searchlight, NV.},

@book{Schmidt-Thome2006,
abstract = {The final report of the ESPON 1.3.1 Hazards project shows the spatial patterns of natural and technological hazards in Europe as an overview on all NUTS3 areas and identifies possible impacts of climate change on selected natural hazards. The approach of the project was to use existing results of hazard research and to combine those in such a way, that the obtained information is comparable over the entire EU 27+2 area. The natural and technological hazards that are relevant for the EU 27+2 area in the ESPON context were selected by specified risk schemes. A so-called spatial filter was applied to ensure that the selected hazards and risks are relevant for spatial planning concerns. For example, floods and major accident hazards have a spatial relevance, meanwhile planning cannot mitigate risks like meteorite impacts or murder. Not all hazards are equally relevant for the entire EU 27+2 area, as the importance of hazards differs among the territory and the perception of the risk. A weighting system, the Delphi method, was used to develop an integrated European hazard. Before developing an integrated picture of aggregated hazards in Europe, the method was tested in several case study areas. The resulting integrated hazard map shows a pattern of high and very high hazardous areas in the shape of a scorpion that has its head in central and southern Germany, the arms reaching out into the Iberian peninsula and the United Kingdom, respectively, and a tail that covers parts of central-eastern European countries before it turns southwards through accession countries into Greece. In this sense the most hazardous spaces of Europe go well beyond both, the so-called "Pentagon" and the "Blue Banana" areas. The risk of hazards is a result of the hazard potential and the vulnerability. The integrated European vulnerability is based on a weighted combination of population, GDP (national and regional) and the proportion of fragmented natural areas to all natural areas. The vulnerability tends to decrease from east to west because of a lower coping capacity, as based on the lower GDP/capita. Unfragmented natural areas show a lower trend towards vulnerability, and densely populated areas with a high GDP per capita show the highest vulnerability, as the total amount of people and assets per km2 poses a higher vulnerability of total damage in case of a disaster. The risk maps reveal a similar "scorpion" pattern of medium risk, meanwhile the highest risk density is found in the "Pentagon" area. The analysis of hazard cluster maps shows that certain Interreg IIIB regions can be associated with certain hazard agglomerations and also with hazard clusters. These hazard clusters comprise storms, floods and storm surges in the North Sea Region and the southern part of the Baltic Sea Region; drought potential and forest fires in the ARCHIMED and South West Europe regions; as well as earthquakes and landslides in the southern part of the CADSES region. Hazards, which magnitude is assumed to increase with the effects of climate change appear to be most severely affecting areas in the Mediterranean and in central Europe. Regions are exposed to hazards in varying degrees, placing them in different "risk positions". The EU Policy instruments should contribute to even out these differences as a matter of European solidarity. Consequently, risk management should be understood as an important task for the cohesion policy. Overall, better inclusion of risks related to natural and technological hazards in EU policies is needed. The report therefore presents some policy recommendations and a proposal for a handbook for spatial planning and risk assessment.},

abstract = {We present new reference values for the NIST SRM 610617 glasses following ISO guidelines and the International Association of Geoanalysts protocol. Uncertainties at the 95{\%} confidence level (CL) have been determined for bulk- and micro-analytical purposes. In contrast to former compilation procedures, this approach delivers data that consider present-day requirements of data quality. New analytical data and the nearly complete data set of the GeoReM database were used for this study. Data quality was checked by the application of the Horwitz function and by a careful investigation of analytical procedures. We have determined quantitatively possible element inhomogeneities using different test portion masses of 1, 0.1 and 0.02 mu g. Although avoiding the rim region of the glass wafers, we found moderate inhomogeneities of several chalcophile/siderophile elements and gross inhomogeneities of Ni, Se, Pd and Pt at small test portion masses. The extent of inhomogeneity was included in the determination of uncertainties. While the new reference values agree with the NIST certified values with the one exception of Mn in SRM 610, they typically differ by as much as 10{\%} from the Pearce (1997) values in current use. In a few cases (P, S, Cl, Ta, Re) the discrepancies are even higher.},

In this sense, monogenetic volcanic fields represent an especially suitable case for the application of such techniques, since eruptive vents can be considered as point-like features. Application of a two-point azimuth method to the Michoac??n-Guanajuato Volcanic Field (Mexico) and the Calatrava Volcanic Province (Spain) demonstrates that the main lineaments controlling the distributions of volcanic vents ({\~{}}. 322?? in Calatrava and {\~{}}. 30?? in Michoac??n) approach the respective main compressional axes that dominate in the area (i.e. the Cocos-North America plates convergence and the main Betics compressional direction, respectively). Considering the stress fields that are present in each volcanic area and their respective geodynamic history, it seems that although volcanism may be a consequence of contemporaneous extensional regimes, the distribution of the volcanic vents in these kinds of monogenetic fields is actually controlled by reactivation of older fractures which then become more favourable for producing space for magma ascent at near-surface levels. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Global sea levels have risen by approximately 0.2 m since 1900 (ref. 1), with projections showing continued changes under anthropogenic warming. However, estimates of future global mean sea-level rise (SLR) vary widely; current projections for the year 2100, for example, range from a low of 0.4 m to a high of 2.5 m (refs 2-4), depending on assumptions of future greenhouse gas emissions, thermal expansion, melt of glaciers and the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, and isostatic adjustment as ice sheets disappear 5. These SLR projections are likely conservative, and continued improvements in ice-sheet modelling suggest high-end SLR predictions are increasingly likely 6,7. With global coastal populations totalling more than 600 million (projected to surpass one billion people this century 8), any level of SLR is expected to impact and potentially displace a large population 9,10. As a result, SLR is anticipated to be one of the most expensive and irreversible future consequences of global climate change 9,11-13 , costing up to 4.5{\%} of global gross domestic product 14. The implications of SLR on human migration first appeared in the scientific literature during the late 1970s 16 , when there was increased recognition that disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could lead to major disruption in coastal cities 16 , resulting in migration. It is now understood that SLR influences human migration in multiple ways. The most apparent influence involves permanent, irreversible inunda-tion of low-elevation areas, which, under SLR, renders land uninhabitable and unavailable for livelihoods 10,12,17 , necessitating relocation. However, various other hazards associated with SLR will also impact migration patterns and, in fact, will exert their influence considerably sooner than complete inundation. Hazards include saltwater intrusion into groundwater and agricultural soils 18-23 , coastal flooding 24-26 , shifts in sediment regimes 27 , coastal erosion 28,29 and increased inland penetration of tropical storm surges 30-33. These hazards could spur migration by permanently destroying irrigated coastal agriculture and fresh drinking water supplies 34,35 , disrupting vital human systems 36-38 , reducing property values 39,40 and, ultimately, destroying property and infrastructure 41,42. SLR also threatens coastal livelihoods such as tourism 43 , coastal aquiculture 44 , fisheries 45 and silviculture 46 , indirectly pressuring migration through adverse impacts on job security. Since the first studies to quantify population displacement due to SLR 15 , our fundamental understanding of SLR and human migration has rapidly advanced with the development of basic theory on climate-change migration 47-50 , empirical case studies of historical analogues for future SLR 51-55 , integrated economic analysis and modelling of SLR retreat 56-58 , explicit models of SLR migration 50,59-61 , as well as contentious policy discussions on the need for coastal retreat 62-65. In some cases, studies even question if SLR will spur widespread migration at all 66,67 , as demonstrated by island residents in the Philippines who would rather adapt in place to SLR-related hazards than follow a relocation programme to the mainland 67. Abstract | Anthropogenic sea-level rise (SLR) is predicted to impact, and, in many cases, displace, a large proportion of the population via inundation and heightened SLR-related hazards. With the global coastal population projected to surpass one billion people this century, SLR might be among the most costly and permanent future consequences of climate change. In this Review, we synthesize the rapidly expanding knowledge of human mobility and migration responses to SLR, providing a coherent roadmap for future SLR research and associated policy. While it is often assumed that direct inundation forces a migration, we discuss how mobility responses are instead driven by a diversity of socioeconomic and demographic factors, which, in some cases, do not result in a migration response. We link SLR hazards with potential mechanisms of migration and the associated governmental or institutional policies that operate as obstacles or facilitators for that migration. Specific examples from the USA, Bangladesh and atoll island nations are used to contextualize these concepts. However, further research is needed on the fundamental mechanisms underlying SLR migration, tipping points, thresholds and feedbacks, risk perception and migration to fully understand migration responses to SLR.},

In the framework of this programme, measurements of indoor radon, principally, have been carried out nationwide. Geometric mean radon concentrations of 45 Bq m(-3) in the whole country and 130 Bq m(-3) in the high natural radiation area have been estimated. On the other hand, the so-called MARNA Project is developed into the framework of an agreement subscribed between the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) and the National Uranium (ENUSA), the first phase of which has been the elaboration of the Natural Gamma Radiation Map of Spain on the scale of 1:1,000,000 using radiometric data generated in the 30 years of the lifetime of the ancient National Uranium Exploration and Investigation Plan mainly through airborne, carborne, and by foot surveys, within the MARNA Project itself. The lowest averaged dose rate from external gamma radiation (19.3 nGyh(-1)) was found in carbonate bedrock and the highest (87.7 nGyh(-1)) was found in granite and clay bedrock. This paper summarizes the main results obtained from the measurements performed in both projects, with special interest in those concerning the correlation between the data reported in order to conclude about the potential benefit of the MARNA maps in the definition of affected areas in the country.},

abstract = {Due to its negative impacts on land productivity and plant growth, soil salinization is a significant problem particularly in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Among the natural factors of soil salinization, parent materials including high amount of salts and minerals in soil structure, known as primary salinization, can be addressed. Conventional irrigation techniques and poor drainage systems are predominant human-induced activities that result in secondary salinization. Countries with especially dryland environment, face difficulty in providing adequate food for their rapidly increasing population since each year lots of cultivated land are abandoned due to adverse effects of primary and secondary soil salinization. Therefore, monitoring, mapping and predicting soil salinization is of utmost importance regarding lessening and/or preventing further increase in soil salinity through some protective measures. The subject of concern becomes even more pronounced particularly in agricultural lands as is the case in the vicinity of Tuz (Salt) Lake Region in Turkey. This research focuses mainly on multi-temporal monitoring of Tuz Lake Region in order to track changes in areas of salty spots in years 1990, 2002, 2006, 2011 and 2015. A total number of 25 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 images obtained between 1990 and 2015 were analysed in this study. Field electrical conductivity (EC) measurements for 322 soil samples in year 2002 were checked; and 28 of these samples were selected for generating salinity maps representing areas in the vicinity of the lake. All satellite images were radiometrically and atmospherically corrected prior to classification. Following the pre-processing step, five soil salinity indices were applied on all satellite images. 28 soil samples were then overlaid on images in order to extract the exact index values related to soil samples and regression approach was used to relate satellite image-derived salinity indices and field measurements. Linear and exponential regression analyses were conducted separately as the next step for all indices based on data gathered in 2002. Salinity index (SI) 1 = B1*B3 showed the best result with R2 value of 0.93 and 0.83 for exponential and linear regression analysis, respectively. Salinity maps for years 1990, 2006, 2011 and 2015 were further produced utilizing the exponential and linear regression expressions attained for year 2002. Besides, this study detected land cover changes in the area from year 2000–2006, and from 2006 to 2012 by using CORINE land cover data to analyse the possible relationships between land cover change and salinity changes.},

We defined coastal regions to range from the continental shelf (to a depth of 200??m), the intertidal areas and adjacent land within 100??km of the coastline. We used the 1??km resolution Global Land Cover Characteristics Database and calculated the area covered by 11 different land cover classes (natural and human-altered ecosystems) within the 100??km limit [Burke, L., Kura, Y., Kasem, K., Revenga, C., Spalding, M., McAllister, D., 2001. Coastal Ecosystems. Washington DC World Resource Institute. 93 pp.]. Cover of aquatic ecosystems was calculated based on several world databases. Our results show that the coasts of the world comprise a wide variety of geomorphological characteristics of which mountainous coasts with a narrow shelf are the most abundant. Sandy shores are found on 16{\%} of the coastal countries. The coasts are located in every weather regime and the number of biomes is equally variable. Within the 100??km limit, 72{\%} still is covered by natural ecosystems and 28{\%} have been altered by human activities (urban and croplands). Open shrubs and evergreen broadleaf forests are the most abundant terrestrial ecosystems. Canada has the largest area of natural and relatively well preserved terrestrial ecosystems. Indonesia and China have the largest percentages of cropland area near the shore, and Japan and the US have the largest coastal urban areas. Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Bahamas and New Caledonia have the largest areas of aquatic ecosystems. The calculated economic value of goods and services provided by coastal ecosystems showed that altogether, coastal ecosystems contribute 77{\%} of global ecosystem-services value calculated by Costanza et al.

More than 50{\%} of the coastal countries have from 80 to 100{\%} of their total population within 100??km of the coastline. Twenty-one of the 33 world's megacities are found on the coast. Multivariate analyses grouped coastal countries according to their ecological, economic and social characteristics. Three gradients explained 55{\%} of the variance: degree of conservation, ecosystem service product and demographic trends. Given the current scenario and the climate change prediction, the coastal environments will be confronting serious environmental issues that should be worked in advance, in order to achieve a sustainable development of the most valued locations of the world.

abstract = {In this paper the very first geochemical and isotopic data related to surface and spring waters and dissolved gases in the area of Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces (Burgos, Spain) are presented and discussed. Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces has been selected as a pilot site for the injection of pure ({\textgreater}99{\%}) CO2. Injection and monitoring wells are planned to be drilled close to 6 oil wells completed in the 1980s for which detailed stratigraphical logs are available, indicating the presence of a confined saline aquifer at the depth of about 1500m into which less than 100,000 tons of liquid CO2 will be injected, possibly starting in 2013.The chemical and features of the spring waters suggest that they are related to a shallow hydrogeological system as the concentration of the Total Dissolved Solids approaches 800mg/L with a Ca2+(Mg2+)-HCO3{\$}\backslash{\$}n- composition, similar to that of the surface waters. This is also supported by the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios that have values lying between those of the Global and the Mediterranean Meteoric Water Lines. Some spring waters close to the oil wells are characterized by relatively high concentrations of NO3{\$}\backslash{\$}n- (up to 123mg/L), unequivocally suggesting an anthropogenic source that adds to the main water-rock interaction processes. The latter can be referred to Ca-Mg-carbonate and, at a minor extent, Al-silicate dissolution, being the outcropping sedimentary rocks characterized by Palaeozoic to Quaternary rocks. Anomalous concentrations of Cl-, SO4{\$}\backslash{\$}n2-, As, B and Ba were measured in two springs discharging a few hundred meters from the oil wells and in the Rio Ubierna. These contents are significantly higher than those of the whole set of the studied waters and are possibly indicative of mixing processes, although at very low extent, between deep and shallow aquifers. No evidence of deep-seated gases interacting with the Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces waters was recognized in the chemistry of the dissolved gases. This is likely due to the fact that they are mainly characterized by an atmospheric source as highlighted by the high contents of N2, O2 and Ar and by N2/Ar ratios that approach that of ASW (Air Saturated Water) and possibly masking any contribution related to a deep source. Nevertheless, significant concentrations (up to 63{\%} by vol.) of isotopically negative CO2 ({\textless}-17.7‰ V-PDB) were found in some water samples, likely related to a biogenic source.The geochemical and isotopic data of this work are of particular importance when a monitoring program will be established to verify whether CO2 leakages, induced by the injection of this greenhouse gas, may be affecting the quality of the waters in the shallow hydrological circuits at Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces. In this respect, carbonate chemistry, the isotopic carbon of dissolved CO2 and TDIC (Total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon) and selected trace elements can be considered as useful parameters to trace the migration of the injected CO2 into near-surface environments. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The comparison is focused on core (metropolitan) and non-core (non-metropolitan) regions. The study found that the development processes of the analysed groups of regions were in many respects similar. Achieving a high level of development in the context of post-socialist transformation was possible mainly owing to exogenous factors such as the influx of foreign direct investment (FDI) and multimodal transport accessibility. In the case of endogenous factors, the number of small- and medium-sized enterprises per capita was of cardinal importance for a high level of development, but it was no guarantee of fast growth dynamics in non-core regions. The main differences between the core and non-core regions included the role of human capital and migrations as metropolitan regions represented growth poles which trained qualified specialists and served as destinations for migrants from non-core regions. However, the share of people with tertiary education played an important role in the development process of non-core regions. The crisis strengthened the role of exogenous growth factors, that is, the role of FDI inflow as well as the role of EU funds.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to estimate long-run elasticities for housing prices in Tehran's (capital of Iran) 20 different zones relative to several explanatory variables available for use such as land price, total substructure area, material price, etc. Moreover, another goal of this paper is to propose a new approach to deal with problems which arise due to a lack of proper data. Design/methodology/approach: The data set is gathered from "The Municipality of Tehran" and "The Central Bank of Islamic Republic of Iran (CBI)". One-way fixed effects and one-way random effects approaches (which are panel data approaches) are applied to model housing price forecasting function in Tehran's 20 different zones. Results are compared with ordinary least squares approach which is a common approach in this field. Finally, outcomes of the preferred approach are discussed and analyzed with regard to the economic point of view. Findings: Results show that one-way fixed effects approach provides more accurate forecasts and can be considered as a suitable tool to deal with housing price forecasting problems in environments which are: uncertain, complex, and faced with a lack of proper data. Moreover, it is found that land price is the most effective factor that has impact on total housing cost in Tehran, i.e. the main portion of house prices in Tehran is affected by land price, so appropriate policies have to be made by the government to control fluctuations of this factor. Practical implications: The proposed approach will supply policy makers with improved estimations with decreased errors in uncertain and complex environments which are faced with a lack of proper data, and it extracts valuable information which enables policy makers for handling non-linearity, complexity, as well as uncertainty that may exist in actual data sets with respect to housing price forecasting. Moreover, the proposed approach can be applied to similar housing price case studies to obtain more accurate and more reliable outcomes. Originality/value: Applying panel data approach for estimation of housing prices is relatively new in the field of housing economics. Moreover, this is the first study which employs panel data approach for analyzing the housing market in Tehran. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Three different methodologies were used to measure Radon ((222)Rn) in soil, based on both passive and active detection system. The first technique consisted of solid-state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD), CR-39 type, and allowed integrated measurements. The second one consisted of a portable device for short time measurements. The last consisted of a continuous measurement device for extended monitoring, placed in selected sites. Soil (222)Rn activity was measured together with soil Thoron ((220)Rn) and soil carbon dioxide (CO(2)) efflux, and it was compared with the content of radionuclides in the rocks. Two different soil-gas horizontal transects were investigated across the Pernicana fault system (NE flank of Mount Etna), from November 2006 to April 2007. The results obtained with the three methodologies are in a general agreement with each other and reflect the tectonic settings of the investigated study area. The lowest (222)Rn values were recorded just on the fault plane, and relatively higher values were recorded a few tens of meters from the fault axis on both of its sides. This pattern could be explained as a dilution effect resulting from high rates of soil CO(2) efflux. Time variations of (222)Rn activity were mostly linked to atmospheric influences, whereas no significant correlation with the volcanic activity was observed. In order to further investigate regional radon distributions, spot measurements were made to identify sites having high Rn emissions that could subsequently be monitored for temporal radon variations. SSNTD measurements allow for extended-duration monitoring of a relatively large number of sites, although with some loss of temporal resolution due to their long integration time. Continuous monitoring probes are optimal for detailed time monitoring, but because of their expense, they can best be used to complement the information acquired with SSNTD in a network of monitored sites.},

abstract = {Soil salinization is one of the most important causes for land degradation and desertification and is an important threat to land management, farming activities, water quality, and sustainable development in arid and semi-arid areas. Soil salinization is often characterized with significant spatiotemporal dynamics. The salt-affected soil is predominant in the Ebinur Lake region in the Northwestern China. However, detailed local soil salinity information is ambiguous at the best due to limited monitoring techniques. Nowadays, the availability of Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2, offers unprecedented perspectives for the monitoring and mapping of soil salinity. The use of MSI data is an innovative attempt for salinity detection in arid land. We hypothesize that field observations and MSI data and MSI data-derived spectral indices using the partial least square regression (PLSR) approach will yield fairly accurate regional salinity map. Based on electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil:water extract (EC) of 72 ground-truth measurements (out of 116 sample sites) and various spectral parameters, such as satellite band reflectance, published satellite salinity indices, red-edge indices, newly constructed two-band indices, and three-band indices from MSI data, we built a few inversion models in an attempt to produce the regional salinity maps. Different algorithms including Pearson correlation coefficient method (PCC), variable importance in projection (VIP), Gray relational analysis (GRA), and random forest (RF) were applied for variable selection. The results suggest that both the newly proposed normalized difference index (NDI) [(B12 − B7) / (B12 + B7)] and three-band index (TBI4) [(B12 − B3) / (B3 − B11)] show a better correlation with validation data and could be applied to estimate the soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region. The established models were validated using the remaining 44 independent ground-based measurements. The RF-PLSR model performed the best across the five models with R2V, RMSEV, and RPD of 0.92, 7.58 dS m−1, and 2.36, respectively. The result from this model was then used to map the soil salinity over the study area. Our analyses suggest that soil salinization changes quite significantly in different seasons. Specifically, soil salinity in the dry season was higher than in the wet season, mostly in the lake area and nearby shores. We contend that the results from the study will be useful for soil salinization monitoring and land reclamation in arid or semi-arid regions outside the current study area.},

abstract = {The administration in many countries demands a classification of areas concerning their radon risk taking into account the requirements of the EU Basic Safety Standards. The wide variation of indoor radon concentrations in an area which is caused by different house construction, different living style and different geological situations introduces large uncertainties for any classification scheme. Therefore, it is of importance to estimate the size of the experimental coefficient of variation (relative standard deviation) of the parameter which is used to classify an area. Besides the time period of measurement it is the number of measurements which strongly influences this uncertainty and it is important to find a compromise between the economic possibilities and the needed confidence level. Some countries do not use pure measurement results for the classification of areas but use derived quantities, usually called radon potential, which should reduce the influence of house construction, living style etc. and should rather represent the geological situation of an area. Here, radon indoor measurements in nearly all homes in three municipalities and its conversion into a radon potential were used to determine the uncertainty of the mean radon potential of an area as a function of the number of investigated homes. It could be shown that the coefficient of variation scales like 1/√n with n the number of measured dwellings. The question how to deal with uncertainties when using a classification scheme for the radon risk is discussed and a general procedure is proposed.},

abstract = {Estuaries have long been regarded as environmentally naturally stressed areas because of the high degree of variability in their physico-chemical characteristics, for example oxygen, temperature and salinity in the water column and bed sediment dynamics. However, their biota is well-adapted to cope with that stress and so the areas may be regarded as resilient because of that inherent variability; their ability to absorb stress without adverse effects is regarded here as Environmental Homeostasis. Hence these areas may only be regarded as stressful for marine or freshwater-adapted organisms and that for estuarine organisms this environmental stress is regarded as a subsidy whereby they successfully capitalise on the stressful conditions. In addition, using examples of the estuarine fauna and flora, this article indicates that the characteristics of natural stress in estuaries are similar to those for anthropogenic stress. An over-reliance on ecosystem structural features, such as diversity, in quality indicators therefore makes the detection of the anthropogenic stress more difficult. This difficulty is termed the Estuarine Quality Paradox. Because of these difficulties, the article argues that functional characteristics either as well as or rather than structural ones should be used in detecting environmental perturbations in estuaries. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {For many years, estuarine science has been the 'poor relation' in aquatic research - freshwater scientists ignored estuaries as they tended to get confused by salt and tides, and marine scientists were more preoccupied by large open systems. Estuaries were merely regarded by each group as either river mouths or sea inlets respectively. For the past four decades, however, estuaries (and other transitional waters) have been regarded as being ecosystems in their own right. Although often not termed as such, this has led to paradigms being generated to summarise estuarine structure and functioning and which relate to both the natural science and management of these systems. This paper defines, details and affirms these paradigms that can be grouped into those covering firstly the science (definitions, scales, linkages, productivity, tolerances and variability) and secondly the management (pressures, valuation, health and services) of estuaries. The more 'science' orientated paradigms incorporate the development and types of ecotones, the nature of stressed and variable systems (with specific reference to resilience and redundancy), the relationship between generalists and specialists produced by environmental tolerance, the relevance of scale in relation to functioning and connectivity, the sources of production and degree of productivity, the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning and the stress-subsidy debates. The more 'management' targeted paradigms include the development and effects of exogenic unmanaged pressures and endogenic managed pressures, the perception of health and the ability to manage estuaries (related to internal and external influences), and the influence of all of these on the production of ecosystem services and societal benefits. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that climate change will intensify during the 21st century. The exact distribution of impacts will likely be complex in nature. Although some areas may exhibit benefits, many areas will likely experience environmental decline. The objective of this article is to answer the following question: What are the potential implications of deteriorating environmental conditions for human migration? This is not an easy question to answer because the full effects of climate change are not yet completely evident. Yet by studying the impact of environmental forces on migration in recent decades, we can offer some insight to this question. Methods. In implementing this approach, we employ theoretical and empirical methods. Our theoretical model suggests that environmental degradation should promote out-migration from affected areas, all other things being equal. To test this prediction empirically, we conduct a large-N statistical analysis focusing on the role of several environmental factors in emigration to developed countries. Our empirical sample covers the late 1980s and the 1990s. Results. The empirical results suggest that environmental decline plays a statistically significant role in out-migration, pushing people to leave their homes and move to other countries. Conclusions. In the conclusions section of this article, we evaluate the policy implications of these findings for developed countries in the context of climate change and national security. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.},

This paper presents results of experiments using Sporosarcina pasteurii biofilms, of varying density, grown on perspex and granite surfaces then immersed in fluids comprising calcium chloride and urea of varying concentrations. Denser biofilms resulting from higher nutrient conditions led to faster nucleation of calcite and higher rates of ammonium production found to be related to crystal size via a power law. The observed morphology of the precipitates was variable depending on precipitation rates and nucleation of calcite was independent of the substrate mineralogy. In some cases the calcite layer became non-porous, and the bridging of pores within the granite was also observed. We show how ureolysis is limited eventually by the encapsulation of the biofilm by calcite and present a novel model that enables the reaction to be optimised to yield maximum calcite precipitation over a desired timescale. Slower reaction rates may in some circumstances be desirable for maximum reaction efficiency. The results have important implications for the design of engineering solutions involving MICP. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper adds to the literature on the determinants of international migration. First, we offer a joint analysis of the driving forces of migration capturing year-to-year variations and long-run effects. Second, we analyze the dynamic response of migration to shocks to its determinants. We start by presenting a theoretical model that allows us to model migration as an augmented gravity equation. We then construct a rich panel data set with 16 destination and 198 origin countries between 1980 and 2015. We find that climate variables are important drivers of migration flows in our sample. We then estimate a panel vectorautoregressive model showing that the dynamic response of migration is very different across shocks to different driving forces. These findings add to the discussion about the effects of climate shocks on mobility and the concept of trapped population. Our findings carry implications for national and international immigration policies.},

Other criteria used in the design of these instruments are field measurements applicability, portability, convenience and reliability.

abstract = {Agriculture and rural life in the Middle East have gone through several changes in the past few decades. The region is characterized by high population growth, urbanization, and water scarcity, which poses a challenge to maintaining food security and production. This paper investigates agricultural and rural challenges in the Duhok governorate of Iraqi Kurdistan from biophysical, political, and socio-economic perspectives. Satellite data is used to study land use and productivity, while a review of government policies and interview data show the perspectives of the government and the local population. Our results reveal that these perspectives are not necessarily in line with each other, nor do they correspond well with the biophysical possibilities. While the government has been trying to increase agricultural productivity, satellite data show that yields have been declining since 2000. Furthermore, a lack of services in rural areas is driving people to cities to seek better opportunities, which means that the local population's incentive to increase agricultural activity is low. Governmental plans suggest land extensification to increase production and self-sufficiency, but the land use classification shows little available land. Instead, we recommend supporting small-scale traditional agriculture development as a more sustainable and feasible alternative. Additionally, more resources need to be focused on improving rural infrastructure and services to increase access to education and health care as a means of gaining support from the local population.},

The present study measured indoor radon concentration nationwide at 5553 points during 1989-2009 and spatially interpolated using lognormal kriging. The incidences of lung cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and leukemia, stratified by sex and five-year age groups in each of the 234 administrative regions in the country during 1999-2008, were obtained from the National Cancer Registry and used to calculate the standardized incidence ratios. After considering regional deprivation index values and smoking rates by sex in each region as confounding variables, the cancer risks were estimated based on Bayesian hierarchical modeling. We found that a 10 Bq/m³ increase in indoor radon concentration was associated with a 1{\%} increase in the incidence of lung cancer in male and a 7{\%} increase in NHL in female children and adolescents in Korea aged less than 20 years. Leukemia was not associated with indoor radon concentration. The increase in NHL risk among young women requires confirmation in future studies, and the radon control program should consider children and adolescents.},

abstract = {Concern about possible links between emissions of radon (Rn) and certain types of malignant disease has led to surveys to measure Rn concentrations in the soil and in dwellings. There is little information about the spatial scales of Rn variation in bedrock and soil. Such information on Rn is needed to effectively sample it in order to measure for spatial prediction. To explore the spatial variation of Rn concentration in soil gas, it was measured using solid-state nuclear track detection in a Rn affected area in the English Midlands. Three surveys are described which show different sampling approaches for exploring spatial variation. The first was a nested survey with seven stages conducted near Buxton in Derbyshire (UK), in an area comprising three principal lithologies (two limestones and a sandstone). The other surveys were south of Buxton on the Monsal Dale limestone. One was an irregularly distributed sample in two dimensions in which Rn concentration, particle size distribution, and elevation were recorded. The other was along a transect 2km long. In addition to Rn concentration, ground conductivity and slope angle were measured at 20m intervals. The results of the nested survey suggest that geology exerts a strong control on Rn variation, and those of the other two surveys that other factors are also involved, such as elevation, soil depth, and soil particle size distribution. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to measure the CO2 fluxes from forest soils by the 222Rn calibrated method and the static chamber method, and to discuss the differences between the methods. Determination of the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in soil, D(CO2), by the 222Rn method allowed us to avoid determining other soil characteristics such as water content, total porosity and tortuosity, which have large uncertainties. The CO2 flux was thus calculated from the determined CO2 diffusion coefficient and the observed gradients of soil CO2 at the soil surface. CO2 flux was also measured with the static chamber method using a chamber placed on the soil surface and calculated from the concentration change in the chamber with time. This study was carded out from July to October, 1994 in two Japanese forests with different vegetation types, one coniferous and the other a mixed deciduous-conifer forest. There was considerable variability in 222Rn fluxes from the soil surface and in CO2 concentrations in the soil air during observational periods. The 222Rn fluxes ranged from 1382 to 3100 dpm m-2 h-1 at the Tsukuba site and from 433 to 3500 dpm m-2 h-1 at the Nikko site. D(CO2) calculated from the results of the 222Rn method ranged from 0.048 to 0.085 cm2s-1 at the Tsukuba site and from 0.006 to 0.066 cm2s-1 at the Nikko site. The results of CO2 flux measurements by the 222Rn method were in agreement with those by the static chamber method within the observed range of error. A multivariate analysis of variance of the results of the two methods revealed no significant differences between them. Vertical profiles of soil CO2 source strength were also calculated from the 222Rn and CO2 concentration gradient data to investigate seasonal change in the soil CO2 production rate. Carbon dioxide production rates varied significantly by season, ranging from 14 (31 October) to 134 mmol m-3 h-1 (11 July) at 5 cm depth at the Tsukuba site and from 5.2 (27 October) to 134 mmol m-3 h-1 (14 July) at 5 cm depth at the Nikko site. These seasonal changes in the CO2 source strength in the surface soil corresponded with changes in CO2 fluxes from the soil.},

@article{Williams2015,
abstract = {These notes borrow very heavily, sometimes verbatim, from Paul Allison's book, Fixed Effects Regression Models for Categorical Data. The Stata XT manual is also a good reference. This handout tends to make lots of assertions; Allison's book does a much better job of explaining why those assertions are true and what the technical details behind the models are. Overview. In experimental research, unmeasured differences between subjects are often controlled for via random assignment to treatment and control groups. Hence, even if a variable like Socio-Economic Status is not explicitly measured, because of random assignment, we can be reasonably confident that the effects of SES are approximately equal for all groups. Of course, random assignment is usually not possible with most survey research. If we want to control for the effect of a variable, we must explicitly measure it. If we don't measure it, we can't control for it. In practice, there will almost certainly be some variables we have failed to measure (or have measured poorly), so our models will likely suffer from some degree of omitted variable bias. Allison notes, however, that when we have panel data (the same subjects measured at two or more points in time) another alternative presents itself: we can use the subjects as their own controls. With binary dependent variables, this can be done via the use of conditional logit/fixed effects logit models. With panel data we can control for stable characteristics (i.e. characteristics that do not change across time) whether they are measured or not. These include such things as sex, race, and ethnicity, as well as more difficult to measure variables such as intelligence, parents' child-rearing practices, and genetic makeup. This does not control for time-varying variables, but such variables can be explicitly included in the model, e.g. employment status, income.},

@article{Carrasco2013,
abstract = {During the deglaciation stages of the last glacial period a rock avalanche took place on the glacier that occupied the upper sector of the Cuerpo de Hombre Valley (Sierra de B{\'{e}}jar). The material displaced during the avalanche fell onto the ice, was transported by the glacier and later deposited as supraglacial ablation till. The cause of the avalanche was the decompression of the valley slopes after they were freed from the glacier ice (stress relaxation). Reconstruction of the ice masses has been carried out to quantify the stress relaxation that produced the collapse. The rock avalanche took place on a lithologically homogeneous slope with a dense fracture network. The avalanche left a 0.4ha scar on the slope with a volume of displaced material of 623±15×103m3. The deposit is an accumulation of large, angular, heterometric boulders (1-100m3 in volume) with a coarse pebble-size matrix. The avalanche can be explained as a relaxation process. This implies rock decompression once the glacier retreat left the wall ice free (debuttressing). Calculations show that the avalanche took place where the decompression stresses were highest (130-170kPa). In the Spanish Central System paleoglaciers the largest accumulation of morainic deposits occurred after the glacial maximum and the earliest stages of the ice retreat. The process described here is used as an example to formulate a hypothesis that the largest accumulations of tills were formed in relation to enhanced slope dynamics once some glacier retreat had occurred. {\textcopyright} 2013 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.},

Here we employ a meta-analysis approach to synthesize the evidence from 30 country-level studies that estimate the effect of slow- and rapid-onset events on migration worldwide. Most studies find that environmental hazards affect migration, although with contextual variation. Migration is primarily internal or to low- and middle-income countries. The strongest relationship is found in studies with a large share of countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, particularly from Latin America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa, and in studies of middle-income and agriculturally dependent countries. Income and conflict moderate and partly explain the relationship between environmental change and migration. Combining our estimates for differential migration responses with the observed environmental change in these countries in recent decades illustrates how the meta-analytic results can provide useful insights for the identification of potential hotspots of environmental migration.},

abstract = {Drylands are considered a net sink for atmospheric methane and a main item of the global inventories of the greenhouse gas budget. It is outlined here, however, that a significant portion of drylands occur over sedimentary basins hosting natural gas and oil reservoirs, where gas migration to the surface takes place, producing positive fluxes of methane into the atmosphere. New field surveys, in different hydrocarbon-prone basins, confirm that microseepage, enhanced by faults and fractures in the rocks, overcomes the methanotrophic consumption occurring in dry soil throughout large areas, especially in the winter season. Fluxes of a few units to some tens of mg m-2 day-1 are frequent over oil-gas fields, whose global extent is estimated at 3.5-4.2millionkm2; higher fluxes ({\textgreater}50mgm-2day-1) are primarily, but not exclusively, found in basins characterized by macro-seeps. Microseepage may however potentially exist over a wider area ({\~{}}8millionkm2, i.e. 15{\%} of global drylands), including the Total Petroleum Systems, coal measures and portions of sedimentary basins that have experienced thermogenesis. Based on a relatively large and geographically dispersed data-set (563 measurements) from different hydrocarbon-prone basins in USA and Europe, upscaling suggests that global microseepage emission exceeding 10Tgyear-1 is very likely. Microseepage is then only one component of a wider class of geological sources, including mud volcanoes, seeps, geothermal and marine seepage, which cannot be ignored in the atmospheric methane budget. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A total of 74 samples of soil, sediment, industrial sludge, and surface water were collected in a Mediterranean estuarine system in order to assess the potential ecological impact of elevated concentrations of Co and Mn associated with a Terephthalic (PTA) and Isophthalic (PIPA) acids production plant. Samples were analyzed for elemental composition (37 elements), pH, redox potential, organic carbon, and CaCO3 content, and a group of 16 selected samples were additionally subjected to a Tessier sequential extraction. Co and Mn soil concentrations were significantly higher inside the industrial facility and around its perimeter than in background samples, and maximum dissolved Co and Mn concentrations were found in a creek near the plant's discharge point, reaching values 17,700 and 156 times higher than their respective background concentrations. The ecological risk was evaluated as a function of Co and Mn fractionation and bioavailability which were controlled by the environmental conditions generated by the advance of seawater into the estuarine system during high tide. Co appeared to precipitate near the river mouth due to the pH increase produced by the influence of seawater intrusion, reaching hazardous concentrations in sediments. In terms of their bioavailability and the corresponding risk assessment code, both Co and Mn present sediment concentrations that result in medium to high ecological risk whereas water concentrations of both elements reach values that more than double their corresponding Secondary Acute Values.},

abstract = {The Ravne tectonic fault in north-west (NW) Slovenia is one of the faults in this region, responsible for the elevated seismic activity at the Italian-Slovene border. Five measurement profiles were fixed in the vicinity of the Ravne fault, four of them were perpendicular and one parallel to the fault. At 18 points along these profiles the following measurements have been carried out: radon activity concentration in soil gas, radon exhalation rate from ground, soil permeability and gamma dose rate. The radon measurements were carried out using the AlphaGuard equipment, and GammaTracer was applied for gamma dose rate measurements. The ranges of the obtained results are as follows: 0.9-32.9 kBq m(-3) for radon concentration (C(Rn)), 1.1-41.9 mBq m(-2) s(-1) for radon exhalation rate (E(Rn)), 0.5-7.4x10(-13) m(2) for soil permeability, and 86-138 nSv h(-1) for gamma dose rate. The concentrations of (222)Rn in soil gas were found to be lower than the average for Slovenia. Because the deformation zones differ not only in the direction perpendicular to the fault but also along it, the behaviour of either C(Rn) or E(Rn) at different profiles differ markedly. The study is planned to be continued with measurements being carried out at a number of additional points.},

abstract = {A new high spatial resolution radon risk map of Ireland has been developed, based on a combination of indoor radon measurements (n = 31,910) and relevant geological information (i.e. Bedrock Geology, Quaternary Geol-ogy, soil permeability and aquifer type). Logistic regression was used to predict the probability of having an in-door radon concentration above the national reference level of 200 Bq m −3 in Ireland. The four geological datasets evaluated were found to be statistically significant, and, based on combinations of these four variables, the predicted probabilities ranged from 0.57{\%} to 75.5{\%}. Results show that the Republic of Ireland may be divided in three main radon risk categories: High (HR), Medium (MR) and Low (LR). The probability of having an indoor radon concentration above 200 Bq m −3 in each area was found to be 19{\%}, 8{\%} and 3{\%}; respectively. In the Republic of Ireland, the population affected by radon concentrations above 200 Bq m −3 is estimated at ca. 460 k (about 10{\%} of the total population). Of these, 57{\%} (265 k), 35{\%} (160 k) and 8{\%} (35 k) are in High, Medium and Low Risk Areas, respectively. Our results provide a high spatial resolution utility which permit customised radon-awareness information to be targeted at specific geographic areas.},

abstract = {The impact of migration on local communities and economies is one of the most important and contentious issues of our time. One particular area of policy concern is the extent to which migration results in an increase in house prices, and whether these effects are consistent across different types of location, ranging from large urban areas, to small urban and rural areas. We contribute to the small but growing literature on migration and housing by examining the impact of migration on house prices at different locations in Sweden. Our model, estimated using IV with a shift-share instrument, allows us to disaggregate the effects of labour migration, family reunification migration, and humanitarian migration, as well as to quantify the effect of internal migration. Using data for 284 municipalities over the period 2000-2015, we find that a 1{\%} increase in the foreign-born population results in a 0.8{\%} increase in house prices, which increases to 1.2{\%} if internal migration is also accounted for, allowing us to account for the effects of the displacement of existing residents. Our results also show that the more skilled labour migrants have a large and positive effect on house prices in large urban areas, while refugees, who are often low-skilled, younger, and less wealthy, have a large effect on house prices in the mainly peripheral, rural or small urban areas where they are placed by the government.},

@article{Pardo-Iguzquiza2008,
abstract = {In many modern applications of geostatistics in the earth sciences, the empirical information is abundant and with complete spatial coverage (e.g. satellite sensor images). In these cases, a critical characteristic of spatial variability is the continuity of the random field that better models the natural phenomenon of interest. Such continuity describes the smoothness of the process at very short distances and is related to the behaviour of the semivariogram near the origin. For this reason, a semivariogram model that is flexible enough to describe the spatial continuity is very convenient for applications. A model that provides such flexibility is the Matern model that controls continuity with a shape parameter. The shape parameter must be larger than zero; a value larger than 1 implies a random field that is m-times mean square differentiable if the shape parameter is larger than m. A package of computer programs is provided for performing the different steps of a geostatistical study using the Matern model and the performance and implementation are illustrated by an example. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Temperature observations at 25 sites in the 2000 km(2) Dee catchment in NE Scotland were used, in conjunction with geographic information system (GIS) analysis, to identify dominant landscape controls on mean monthly maximum stream temperatures. Maximum winter stream temperatures are mainly controlled by elevation, catchment area and hill shading, whereas the maximum temperatures in summer are driven by more complex interactions, which include the influence of riparian forest cover and distance to coast. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the catchment-wide distribution of mean weekly maximum stream temperatures for the hottest week of the 2-year observation period. The results suggested the streams most sensitive to high temperatures are small upland streams at exposed locations without any forest cover and relatively far inland, while lowland streams with riparian forest cover at locations closer to the coast exhibit a moderated thermal regime. Under current conditions, all streams provide a suitable thermal habitat for both, Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Using two climate change scenarios assuming 2.5 and 4 degrees C air temperature increases, respectively, temperature-sensitive zones of the stream network were identified, which could potentially have an adverse effect on the thermal habitat of Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Analysis showed that the extension of riparian forests into headwater streams has the potential to moderate changes in temperature under climate change. Copyright.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been proposed as a viable means for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Once injection begins, a program for measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) of CO2 distribution is required in order to: a) research key features, effects and processes needed for risk assessment; b) manage the injection process; c) delineate and identify leakage risk and surface escape; d) provide early warnings of failure near the reservoir; and f) verify storage for accounting and crediting. The selection of the methodology of monitoring (characterization of site and control and verification in the post-injection phase) is influenced by economic and technological variables. Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) refers to a methodology developed for making decisions in the presence of multiple criteria. MCDM as a discipline has only a relatively short history of 40 years, and it has been closely related to advancements on computer technology. Evaluation methods and multicriteria decisions include the selection of a set of feasible alternatives, the simultaneous optimization of several objective functions, and a decision-making process and evaluation procedures that must be rational and consistent. The application of a mathematical model of decision-making will help to find the best solution, establishing the mechanisms to facilitate the management of information generated by number of disciplines of knowledge. Those problems in which decision alternatives are finite are called Discrete Multicriteria Decision problems. Such problems are most common in reality and this case scenario will be applied in solving the problem of site selection for storing CO2. Discrete MCDM is used to assess and decide on issues that by nature or design support a finite number of alternative solutions. Recently, Multicriteria Decision Analysis has been applied to hierarchy policy incentives for CCS, to assess the role of CCS, and to select potential areas which could be suitable to store. For those reasons, MCDM have been considered in the monitoring phase of CO2 storage, in order to select suitable technologies which could be techno-economical viable. In this paper, we identify techniques of gas measurements in subsurface which are currently applying in the phase of characterization (pre-injection); MCDM will help decision-makers to hierarchy the most suitable technique which fit the purpose to monitor the specific physic-chemical parameter.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Numerical modelling is a powerful tool for studies of soil gas and radon-222 entry into houses. It is the purpose of this paper to review some main techniques and results. In the past, modelling has focused on Darcy flow of soil gas (driven by indoor-outdoor pressure differences) and combined diffusive and advective transport of radon. Models of different complexity have been used. The simpler ones are finite-difference models with one or two spatial dimensions. The more complex models allow for full three-dimensional and time dependency. Advanced features include: soil heterogeneity, anisotropy, fractures, moisture, non-uniform soil temperature, non-Darcy flow of gas, and flow caused by changes in the atmospheric pressure. Numerical models can be used to estimate the importance of specific factors for radon entry. Models are also helpful when results obtained in special laboratory or test structure experiments need to be extrapolated to more general situations (e.g. to real houses or even to other soil-gas pollutants). Finally, models provide a cost-effective test bench for improved designs of radon prevention systems. The paper includes a summary of transport equations and boundary conditions. As an illustrative example, radon entry is calculated for a standard slab-on-grade house. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Artvin province, which has a quite hilly terrain and wide variety of soil and located in the north-east of Turkey, is selected as the study area. Outdoor gamma dose rate (OGDR), which is an important determinant of environmental radioactivity level, is measured in 204 stations. Spatial structure of OGDR is determined by anisotropic, isotropic and residual variograms. Ordinary kriging (OK) and universal kriging (UK) interpolation estimations were calculated with the help of model parameters obtained from these variograms. In OK, although calculations are made based on positions of points where samples are taken, in the UK technique, general soil groups and altitude values directly affecting OGDR are included in the calculations. When two methods are evaluated based on their performances, it has been determined that UK model (r = 0.88, p {\textless} 0.001) gives quite better results than OK model (r = 0.64, p {\textless} 0.001). In addition, as a result of the maps created at the end of the study, it was illustrated that local changes are better reflected by UK method compared to OK method and its error variance is found to be lower.},

abstract = {Human migration is a type of human mobility, where a trip involves a person moving with the intention of changing their home location. Predicting human migration as accurately as possible is important in city planning applications, international trade, spread of infectious diseases, conservation planning, and public policy development. Traditional human mobility models, such as gravity models or the more recent radiation model, predict human mobility flows based on population and distance features only. These models have been validated on commuting flows, a different type of human mobility, and are mainly used in modeling scenarios where large amounts of prior ground truth mobility data are not available. One downside of these models is that they have a fixed form and are therefore not able to capture more complicated migration dynamics. We propose machine learning models that are able to incorporate any number of exogenous features, to predict origin/destination human migration flows. Our machine learning models outperform traditional human mobility models on a variety of evaluation metrics, both in the task of predicting migrations between US counties as well as international migrations. In general, predictive machine learning models of human migration will provide a flexible base with which to model human migration under different what-if conditions, such as potential sea level rise or population growth scenarios.},

abstract = {Increasingly, research is moving towards more interdisciplinary endeavours. Effective collaboration between people from different disciplines is necessary to maximize the potential benefits of interdisciplinarity for future research activity. This paper analyses an approach to fostering the skills required for successful cross-disciplinary collaboration from the perspective of an interdisciplinary group of early-career researchers. Our reflection on how specially designed encounters can help to shape future interdisciplinary research initiatives draws on the discussion of a four-day workshop, a post-event survey, and a review of other experiences. We conclude that interdisciplinary encounters are an effective means to support the development of future interdisciplinary researchers, with a major advantage of this approach being the opportunity for open communication. Depending on the organiser's aim, we distinguish between "cultivation" and "development" encounters. Among the multiple factors that produce successful interdisciplinary encounters, we found that selection of a theme, participants and location need to be tailored to the encounter's particular objectives. We recommend that funding bodies and other members of the research community should take note of the effectiveness of encounters to foster interdisciplinarity and generate space to develop more innovative and high-impact research that delivers solutions to the challenges facing humanity in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Global land cover maps are important sources of information for a wide range of studies including land change analysis and climate change research. While the global land cover maps attempt to present a consistent and homogenous data in terms of the production process, the existing datasets offer coarse resolution data, e.g. 1000 m for IGBP DISCover and 300 m for GlobeCover 2009 that is oftentimes challenging. Recently, GlobeLand30 data based on Landsat archive for two timestamps of 2000 and 2010 has been released. It presents a finer spatial resolution of 30 m, which provides numerous opportunities for a wide range of studies. The main objective of this study is to use this dataset for characterizing global land cover patterns, monitoring, and identifying extreme land change cases with their types and magnitude. The findings reveal massive land change patterns including deforestation, desertification, shrinkage of water bodies, and urbanization across the globe. The results and discussions of this research can help policy-makers, environmental planners, ecosystem services providers and climate change researchers to gain finer insights about the forms of global land change. Future research calls for further investigation of the underlying causes of the massive changes and their consequences on our ecosystems and human populations.},

abstract = {A change in housing prices has a profound impact on households' housing equity and future moving decisions. While most previous studies focus on discussing the mobility lock-in effect due to housing price depreciation, revealing that there is a positive relationship between housing prices and migration, this study reexamines their relationship by using the panel cointegration method and city-level panel data for Taiwan during the 1994–2016 period. The empirical results reveal that migration and housing prices are cointegrated, and the influence of housing prices on migration is significantly positive in the long run. However, the influence of housing price changes on migration is not as significant as expected in the short run. To further examine their short-run relationships, we use quantile regression and the results show that the influence of housing price changes on migration is significantly negative below the 0.5 quantile, but it turns out to be significantly positive in the 0.9 quantile. The influence of housing price changes on migration is not significant between the 0.5 and 0.8 quantiles. We conclude that the influence of housing price changes on migration might be asymmetric in the short run.},

abstract = {From the end of 2013 and during the following two years, 20kt of CO2sc are planned to be injected in a saline reservoir (1500m depth) at the Hontom{\'{i}}n site (NE Spain). The target aquifers are Lower Jurassic limestone formations which are sealed by Lower Cretaceous clay units at the Hontom{\'{i}}n site (NE Spain). The injection of CO2 is part of the activities committed in the Technology Development phase of the EC-funded OXYCFB300 project (European Energy Program for Recovery - EEPR, http://www.compostillaproject.eu), which include CO2 injection strategies, risk assessment, and testing and validating monitoring methodologies and techniques.Among the monitoring works, the project is intended to prove that present-day technology is able to monitor the evolution of injected CO2 in the reservoir and to detect potential leakage. One of the techniques is the measurement of CO2 flux at the soil-atmosphere interface, which includes campaigns before, during and after the injection operations.In this work soil CO2 flux measurements in the vicinity of oil borehole, drilled in the eighties and named H-1 to H-4, and injection and monitoring wells were performed using an accumulation chamber equipped with an IR sensor. Seven surveys were carried out from November 2009 to summer 2011. More than 4000 measurements were used to determine the baseline flux of CO2 and its seasonal variations.The measured values were low (from 5 to 13gm-2day-1) and few outliers were identified, mainly located close to the H-2 oil well. Nevertheless, these values cannot be associated to a deep source of CO2, being more likely related to biological processes, i.e. soil respiration. No anomalies were recognized close to the deep fault system (Ubierna Fault) detected by geophysical investigations. There, the CO2 flux is indeed as low as other measurement stations. CO2 fluxes appear to be controlled by the biological activity since the lowest values were recorded during autumn-winter seasons and they tend to increase in warm periods. Two reference CO2 flux values (UCL50 of 5gm-2d-1 for non-ploughed areas in autumn-winter seasons and 3.5 and 12gm-2d-1 for in ploughed and non-ploughed areas, respectively, in spring-summer time, and UCL99 of 26gm-2d-1 for autumn-winter in not-ploughed areas and 34 and 42gm-2d-1 for spring-summer in ploughed and not-ploughed areas, respectively) were calculated. Fluxes higher than these reference values could be indicative of possible leakage during the operational and post-closure stages of the storage project. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sediments with unusually high manganese contents occur in anoxic basins of the central Baltic Sea. We present a new model for the enrichment of manganese which is based on sedimentological and geochemical analyses of Holocene sediments from the Gotland Deep, and on published hydrographic data. Due to salinity stratification and high primary production, bottom waters of the central Baltic Sea are anoxic and rich in dissolved Mn2+. Episodically, bottom waters become oxygenated by inflows of denser water from the North Sea. Mixing results in oxidation of Mn2+ to fine-grained particulate oxides which accumulate in the deepest parts of the basins where currents are mostly absent. Here, anoxic conditions are re-established within a few months or years, and manganese oxides are again dissolved causing high concentrations of Mn2+ in the near-bottom layer. Alkalinity is high as a consequence of bacterial reduction of manganese oxides and sulphate. Under these conditions, manganese is reprecipitated and forms a layer of Ca-rich rhodochrosite on the top of laminated sapropels. Occasionally, periods of such extremely and rapidly changing redox-conditions are followed by long-term oxygenation of bottom waters. In that case, a layer rich in manganese oxides forms on the top of a bioturbated layer due to dissolution of rhodochrosite and oxidation of manganese in the near-surface sediment. Return of anoxic conditions results again in the transformation of manganese oxides into rhodochrosite. Varying rhodochrosite contents in the basinal sediments therefore record a detailed history of redox-conditions in bottom waters. The manganese-rich sediments of the Baltic Sea share many features with some occurrences of Lower Jurassic and Lower Carboniferous manganese ores in western and central Europe. We therefore suggest that these manganese enrichments were formed by similar processes.},

abstract = {Shallow landslides usually occur during hevy rainfall and result in casualties and property losses. Thus, the possible locations where landslides are likely to occur must be identified in advance in order to avoid or reduce the harm they cause. When performing a slope-instability analysis, soil thickness is an important factor; however, soil thickness information from landslide-prone areas is rarely obtained. The objective of this study is to realize the influences of spatial distribution of soil thickness on shallow landslide prediction. Three different spatial soil-thickness distributions were applied to perform a slope-instability analysis, and uniform-distributed soil thicknesses from 0.4. m to 2.0. m were also applied for comparison. Geomorphologic information and hydrological records from a landslide-prone area in southern Taiwan were collected. Results show that the spatial distribution of soil thickness related to wetness index provides a reasonable estimation in order to avoid an over-prediction for landslide-prone areas or an under-prediction for stable areas. The analytical procedure used in this study is a simple way for assessing hillslope instability for shallow landslide prediction. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the aftermath of postvolcanic activity, dry gases, containing mainly CO(2), bring along radioactive gases such as radon ((222)Rn) and thoron ((220)Rn) that migrate together to the surface. Tectonic faults facilitate the upward migration of these gases. The study described here is based on measurements of radon and thoron activity concentrations performed around the mofettes and mineral springs at Harghita Bai, Harghita Mts. (part of the Neogene Volcanic region of the Eastern Carpathians, Romania). The aim of the study was to identify the location and the direction of the fault system that controls the occurrence of the two mofettes, as well as the mineral springs in the resort by means of systematic measurements of soil radon and thoron activity concentrations. During fieldwork, the existence of the presumed fault system across two different profiles, normal to assumed fault directions, was examined. We sought to identify the local fault hypothetically traced across the two mofettes directed at N 50 degrees W. We also considered the major fault system connecting mofettes and mineral springs, whose direction is N 5 degrees E. For radon and thoron concentration determinations in soil gas, we used a main measurement method (a LUK3C scintillation detector with Lucas cells). Results showed normal distributions for the activity concentrations for both radon and thoron, with a maximum value in both cases. The concentrations for radon and thoron were in the range of several kBq m(-3) to tens of kBq m(-3). The distributions are consistent with the hypothesis that the fault lines cross at the point corresponding to maximum values of the radon and thoron concentrations. From the results it is also clear that high precision thoron concentration determinations provided a more accurate location for this type of geological environment than for radon alone, because of its shorter half-life and its shorter migration length.},

abstract = {Indoor radon is regularly measured in Switzerland. However, a nationwide model to predict residential radon levels has not been developed. The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model to assess indoor radon concentrations in Switzerland. The model was based on 44,631 measurements from the nationwide Swiss radon database collected between 1994 and 2004. Of these, 80{\%} randomly selected measurements were used for model development and the remaining 20{\%} for an independent model validation. A multivariable log-linear regression model was fitted and relevant predictors selected according to evidence from the literature, the adjusted R2, the Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The prediction model was evaluated by calculating Spearman rank correlation between measured and predicted values. Additionally, the predicted values were categorised into three categories (50th, 50th-90th and 90th percentile) and compared with measured categories using a weighted Kappa statistic. The most relevant predictors for indoor radon levels were tectonic units and year of construction of the building, followed by soil texture, degree of urbanisation, floor of the building where the measurement was taken and housing type (P-values {\textless}0.001 for all). Mean predicted radon values (geometric mean) were 66 Bq/m3 (interquartile range 40-111 Bq/m3) in the lowest exposure category, 126 Bq/m3 (69-215 Bq/m3) in the medium category, and 219 Bq/m3 (108-427 Bq/m3) in the highest category. Spearman correlation between predictions and measurements was 0.45 (95{\%}-CI: 0.44; 0.46) for the development dataset and 0.44 (95{\%}-CI: 0.42; 0.46) for the validation dataset. Kappa coefficients were 0.31 for the development and 0.30 for the validation dataset, respectively. The model explained 20{\%} overall variability (adjusted R2).In conclusion, this residential radon prediction model, based on a large number of measurements, was demonstrated to be robust through validation with an independent dataset. The model is appropriate for predicting radon level exposure of the Swiss population in epidemiological research. Nevertheless, some exposure misclassification and regression to the mean is unavoidable and should be taken into account in future applications of the model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We present a comparative study of soil CO2 flux (F-CO2) measured by five groups (Groups 1-5) at the IAVCEI-CCVG Eighth Workshop on Volcanic Gases on Masaya volcano, Nicaragua. Groups 1-5 measured F-CO2 using the accumulation chamber method at 5-m spacing within a 900 m{\textless}Superscript{\textgreater}2supercript stop grid during a morning (AM) period. These measurements were repeated by Groups 1-3 during an afternoon (PM) period. Measured F-CO2 ranged from 218 to 14,719 g m(-2) day(-1). The variability of the five measurements made at each grid point ranged from +/- 5 to 167{\%}. However, the arithmetic means of fluxes measured over the entire grid and associated total CO2 emission rate estimates varied between groups by only +/- 22{\%}. All three groups that made PM measurements reported an 8-19{\%} increase in total emissions over the AM results. Based on a comparison of measurements made during AM and PM times, we argue that this change is due in large part to natural temporal variability of gas flow, rather than to measurement error. In order to estimate the mean and associated CO2 emission rate of one data set and to map the spatial F-CO2 distribution, we compared six geostatistical methods: arithmetic and minimum variance unbiased estimator means of uninterpolated data, and arithmetic means of data interpolated by the multiquadric radial basis function, ordinary kriging, multi-Gaussian kriging, and sequential Gaussian simulation methods. While the total CO2 emission rates estimated using the different techniques only varied by +/- 4.4{\%}, the F-CO2 maps showed important differences. We suggest that the sequential Gaussian simulation method yields the most realistic representation of the spatial distribution of F-CO2, but a variety of geostatistical methods are appropriate to estimate the total CO2 emission rate from a study area, which is a primary goal in volcano monitoring research.},

Based on a dedicated benchmark exercise and on 3 days of in-depth discussion, recommendations have been made for future model improvements, new strategies of ash cloud forecasting, multidisciplinary data acquisition and more efficient communication between different communities. Issues addressed in the workshop include ash dispersal modelling, uncertainty, ensemble forecasting, combining dispersal models and observations, sensitivity analysis, model variability, data acquisition, pre-eruption forecasting, first simulation and data assimilation, research priorities and new communication strategies to improve information flow and operational routines. As a main conclusion, model developers, meteorologists, volcanologists and stakeholders need to work closely together to develop new and improved strategies for ash dispersal forecasting and, in particular, to: (1) improve the definition of the source term, (2) design models and forecasting strategies that can better characterize uncertainties, (3) explore and identify the best ensemble strategies that can be adapted to ash dispersal forecasting, (4) identify optimized strategies for the combination of models and observations and (5) implement new critical operational strategies.},

abstract = {CO2 flux measurements at the soil–atmosphere interface are commonly carried out as part of site characterization in areas elected for CO2 geological storage purposes. This approach represents an important monitoring tool to detect and quantify leakages during operational and post-operational stages related to the injection of anthropogenic CO2. A large variety of techniques to measure diffuse CO2 soil flux is available and one of the most widely used is the accumulation chamber method. With this method, the total output is statistically estimated after measuring the CO2 flux in selected points of a certain area. Several statistical approaches can be applied and it is important to select the most representative and significant procedure. Consequently, in this paper six different methods were used to calculate the total CO2 output, as follows: arithmetic mean, minimum variances unbiased estimator, bootstrap resample, partitioning of data into different populations with graphical and maximum likelihood procedures, and sequential Gaussian simulation. Eight campaigns were carried out in the Hontom{\'{i}}n CO2 Storage Technology Development Plant (Burgos, Spain) and in natural analogs of CO2 storage (Campo de Calatrava, Spain and Mt. Amiata, Caprese Michelangelo and La Solfatara, Italy). Our results showed that sequential Gaussian simulation is the most precise method for evaluating the total CO2 output and the respective confidence interval. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total CO2 output with other statistical methodologies allowed to develop an application procedure for choosing the most reliable and realistic approach.},

abstract = {The present research study investigates the application of nonlinear normalizing data transformations in conjunction with ordinary kriging (OK) for the accurate prediction of groundwater level spatial variability in a sparsely-gauged basin. We investigate three established normalizing methods, Gaussian anamorphosis, trans-Gaussian kriging and the Box-Cox method to improve the estimation accuracy. The first two are applied for the first time to groundwater level data. All three methods improve the mean absolute prediction error compared to the application of OK to the non-transformed data. In addition, a modified Box-Cox transformation is proposed and applied to normalize the hydraulic heads. The modified Box-Cox transformation in conjunction with OK is found to be the optimal spatial model based on leave-one-out cross-validation. The recently established Spartan semivariogram family provides the optimal model fit to the transformed data. Finally, we present maps of the groundwater level and the kriging variance based on the optimal spatial model.Editor D. Koutsoyiannis; Associate editor A.

abstract = {The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force, jointly convened by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the National Ocean Council (NOC), began its work in August 2015. The Task Force has focused its efforts on three primary tasks: 1) updating scenarios of global mean sea level (GMSL) rise, 2) integrating the global scenarios with regional factors contributing to sea level change for the entire U.S. coastline, and 3) incorporating these regionally appropriate scenarios within coastal risk management tools and capabilities deployed by individual agencies in support of the needs of specific stakeholder groups and user communities. This technical report focuses on the first two of these tasks and reports on the production of gridded relative sea level (RSL, which includes both ocean-level change and vertical land motion) projections for the United States associated with an updated set of GMSL scenarios. In addition to supporting the longer-term Task Force effort, this new product will be an important input into the USGCRP Sustained Assessment process and upcoming Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4) due in 2018. This report also serves as a key technical input into the in-progress USGCRP Climate Science Special Report (CSSR). In order to bound the set of GMSL rise scenarios for year 2100, we assessed the most up-to-date scientific literature on scientifically supported upper-end GMSL projections, including recent observational and modeling literature related to the potential for rapid ice melt in Greenland and Antarctica. The projections and results presented in several peer-reviewed publications provide evidence to support a physically plausible GMSL rise in the range of 2.0 meters (m) to 2.7 m, and recent results regarding Antarctic ice-sheet instability indicate that such outcomes may be more likely than previously thought. To ensure consistency with these recent updates to the peer-reviewed scientific literature, we recommend a revised ‘extreme' upper-bound scenario for GMSL rise of 2.5 m by the year 2100, which is 0.5 m higher than the upper bound scenario from Parris et al. (2012) employed by the Third NCA (NCA3). In addition, after consideration of tide gauge and altimeter-based estimates of the rates of GMSL change over the past quarter-century and of recent modeling of future low-end projections of GMSL rise, we revise Parris et al. (2012)'s estimate of the lower bound upward by 0.1 m to 0.3 m by the year 2100. This report articulates the linkages between scenario-based and probabilistic projections of future sea levels for coastal-risk planning, management of long-lived critical infrastructure, mission readiness, and other purposes. The probabilistic projections discussed in this report recognize the inherent dependency (conditionality) of future GMSL rise on future greenhouse-gas emissions and associated ocean-atmosphere warming. In recognition of the different time horizons of relevance to different decision contexts, as well as the long-term GMSL rise commitment (lagged GMSL response) from on-going increases in ocean-atmosphere warming, GMSL rise and associated RSL change are quantified from the year 2000 through the year 2200 (on a decadal basis to 2100 and with lower temporal frequency between 2100 and 2200). The 0.3 m-2.5 m GMSL range for 2100 is discretized by 0.5-m increments and aligned with emissions-based, conditional probabilistic storylines and global model projections into six GMSL rise scenarios: a Low, Intermediate-Low, Intermediate, Intermediate-High, High and Extreme, which correspond to GMSL rise of 0.3 m, 0.5 m, 1.0 m, 1.5 m, 2.0 m and 2.5 m, respectively. These GMSL rise scenarios are used to derive regional RSL responses on a 1-degree grid covering the coastlines of the U.S. mainland, Alaska, Hawaii, the Caribbean, and the Pacific island territories, as well as at the precise locations of tide gauges along these coastlines. These scenario-based RSL values fill a major gap in climate information needed to vii support a wide range of assessment, planning, and decision-making processes. GMSL was adjusted to account for key factors important at regional scales, including: 1) shifts in oceanographic factors such as circulation patterns; 2) changes in the Earth's gravitational field and rotation, and the flexure of the crust and upper mantle, due to melting of land-based ice; and 3) vertical land movement (VLM; subsidence or uplift) due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA, which also changes Earth's gravitational field and rotation, as well as the overall shape of the ocean basin), sediment compaction, groundwater and fossil fuel withdrawals, and other nonclimatic factors. Key findings include: ● Along regions of the Northeast Atlantic (Virginia coast and northward) and the western Gulf of Mexico coasts, RSL rise is projected to be greater than the global average for almost all future GMSL rise scenarios (e.g., 0.3-0.5 m or more RSL rise by the year 2100 than GMSL rise under the Intermediate scenario). ● Along much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska coasts, RSL is projected to be less than the global average under the Low-to-Intermediate scenarios (e.g., 0.1-1 m or less RSL rise by the year 2100 than GMSL rise under the Intermediate scenario). ● Along almost all U.S. coasts outside Alaska, RSL is projected to be higher than the global average under the Intermediate-High, High and Extreme scenarios (e.g., 0.3-1 m or more RSL rise by the year 2100 than GMSL rise under the High scenario). Finally, the consequences of rising RSL are presented in terms of how the frequency of moderate-level flooding associated with a NOAA coastal/lakeshore flood warning of a serious risk to life and property may change in the future under the sea level scenarios. The elevation threshold used to classify such events by NOAA on their tide gauges varies along the U.S. coastline, but in general it is about 0.8 m (2.6 feet) above the highest average tide and locally has a 20{\%} annual chance of occurrence. For example, using the flood-frequency definition, we find at most locations examined (90 cities along the U.S. coastline outside of Alaska) that with only about 0.35 m ({\textless}14 inches) of local RSL rise, annual frequencies of such disruptive/damaging flooding will increase 25-fold by or about (±5 years) 2080, 2060, 2040 and 2030 under the Low, Intermediate-Low, Intermediate and Intermediate High subset of scenarios, respectively.},

In this article it is argued that Myers underestimates the potentials of panel data for the study of housing market dynamics over time. Panel data are now relatively easy to obtain and use, also for the analysis of long-term changes in housing markets. Prices and turnover rates in housing markets have been shown to be strongly auto-correlated across geographical space.

abstract = {CO2 capture and storage (CCS) projects are presently developed to reduce the emission of anthropogenic CO2 into the atmosphere. CCS technologies are expected to account for the 20{\%} of the CO2 reduction by 2050. Geophysical, ground deformation and geochemical monitoring have been carried out to detect potential leakage, and, in the event that this occurs, identify and quantify it. This monitoring needs to be developed prior, during and after the injection stage. For a correct interpretation and quantification of the leakage, it is essential to establish a pre-injection characterization (baseline) of the area affected by the CO2 storage at reservoir level as well as at shallow depth, surface and atmosphere, via soil gas measurements. Therefore, the methodological approach is important because it can affect the spatial and temporal variability of this flux and even jeopardize the total value of CO2 in a given area. In this sense, measurements of CO2 flux were done using portable infrared analyzers (i.e., accumulation chambers) adapted to monitoring the geological storage of CO2, and other measurements of trace gases, e.g. radon isotopes and remote sensing imagery were tested in the natural analogue of Campo de Calatrava (Ciudad Real, Spain) with the aim to apply in CO2 leakage detection; thus, observing a high correlation between CO2 and radon (r=0,858) and detecting some vegetation indices that may be successfully applied for the leakage detection. {\textcopyright}2014 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

Two soil texture components (clay and silt) were found to be correlated with soil nitrate-N, P, and K, and were used as auxiliary variables in the cokriging procedure to estimate soil nitrate-N, P, and K at unsampled locations. With a sampling density of 2.7 sites/ha (61 X 61 m grid) as the baseline, removal of 50{\%} of the sampling sites resulted in a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 34.5{\%}, 22.9{\%}, and 15.3{\%} for soil nitrate-N, P, and K, respectively. These numbers reduced to 32.8{\%}, 20.7{\%}, and 12.0{\%} when only 25{\%} of the sampling sites were removed. The study showed that the cokriging technique provided slightly better estimates than the ordinary kriging method for soil P and K at a higher sampling density ({\textgreater}2.1 sites/ha). However, when a variable has a large random variation, such as the soil nitrate-N, cokriging did not provide better estimates than ordinary kriging. The results of this study provide guidelines on the selection of kriging or cokriging in improving the soil nutrient sampling efficiency.},

Under such climatic conditions, soluble salts are accumulated in the soil, influencing soil properties with ultimate decline in productivity. An integrated approach using remote sensing in addition to various statistical methods has shown success for developing soil salinity prediction models. The present study presents a model to map soil salinity using remote sensing and geographic information systems. Different spectral indices were calculated from original bands of landsat images. Statistical correlation between field measurements of electrical conductivity (ECe) and remote sensing spectral indices showed that salinity index (SI) had the highest correlation with ECe. Combining these remotely sensed and ECe variables into one model yielded the best fit with R2 = 0.78. The result obtained from SI was not only area-wise, but also with its intensity. Out of the total area, 18.8{\%} and 23{\%} were identified as moderately and slightly saline, respectively. This shows that remote sensing data can be effectively used to model and map spatial variations of soil salinity in irrigation areas.},

Soil gas radon concentration ranges between 7 and 176 kBq/m3 indicating a large degree of variability in the NORM content and behavior of the parent soil material related in particular to the occurrence of two different lithologies. Soil gas radon mapping confirmed the existence of two different areas: one along the shoreline of the Bolsena lake, characterized by low soil radon level, due to a prevailing alluvial lithology; another close to the Bolsena village with high soil radon level due to the presence of the high radioactive volcanic rocks of the Vulsini volcanic district. Radon risk assessment, based on soil gas radon and permeability data, results in a map where the alluvial area is characterized by a probability to be an area with high Radon Index lower than 20 {\%}, while probabilities higher than 30 {\%} and also above 50 {\%} are found close to the Bolsena village.},

abstract = {Historically, a significant level of mining activity has taken place in the batholite-related metalogenic enclave of Linares (Ja??n province, Spain), associated with Pb-Ag, Cu, Zn and Fe sulphides and Ba sulphate mineralization, though mining here has now been abandoned. Additionally, the area features a significant amount of urban, industrial and agricultural activities. These considerations, taken together, explain the need to assess the levels of concentration of trace elements and to determine their relationship with geogenic and anthropogenic factors. For geochemical characterisation of the soil, the region has been divided into 126 grid squares with an area of 1 km2. For each grid square, 32 trace elements have been analysed. Elemental concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn, As and Mn have been included in statistical analyses. According to the reference levels established by the Regional Government (Junta de Andaluc??a), soils in a large part of the study area require amendment applications. The comparison of the mean content for each grid square with the reference levels reveals a significant degree of contamination of the soil by Cu (719 mg kg-1), Pb (22,964 mg kg-1) and As (100 mg kg-1) in those grid squares affected by metallurgic activities. By means of factor analysis, four scores have been identified which together account for 80{\%} of the variance observed. The first score is highly correlated with the logarithms of the variables Fe, Th, La, Ti, Al, Na, K, Zr, Y, Nb, Be and Sc. It is a "natural" factor that indicates the type of soil matrix (fundamentally granites and, to a lesser degree, Triassic materials). The second score shows high correlation with the logarithms of the variables Mo, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Co, Mn, As, Cd, Sb, Ba, W and Sn, and is the "metallization" factor related to the mineralization that has been exploited. The third score is mainly determined by the logarithms of the variables Sr, Ca and Mg. This is a "natural" factor that indicates a type of carbonate soil matrix (Miocene). Finally, the fourth factor groups the logarithms of the variables Ni, V and Cr, elements that are associated with the combustion of fossil fuels. Analysis of the patterns of each of the factors identified enabled achieving a global characterisation of the study area. Cluster analysis of the observations showed there to be five clusters relating to the grid squares, differentiated by lithologies and degrees of contamination. These clusters are used to determine the background of granite and to calculate the anomalous load. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In Canada, a radon and radon progeny survey was carried out in the 1970s in 19 cities. To the authors' knowledge, this is the only large survey of simultaneous radon and radon progeny measurements up to the present time. However, the survey was carried out for the purpose of establishing geographic variation of radon and radon progeny; therefore, radon equilibrium factors, F, were not assessed at that time. From the summary results of this large simultaneous radon and radon progeny survey, the characteristics of radon equilibrium factor were assessed. The average F factor assessed from this survey in 12,576 houses is 0.54. The current assessment may indicate that the typical F value of 0.4 recommended by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) could lead to a downward bias in the estimation of radon doses to the lung. {\textcopyright} 2011 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.},

abstract = {A change in housing prices has a profound impact on households' housing equity and future moving decisions. While most previous studies focus on discussing the mobility lock-in effect due to housing price depreciation, revealing that there is a positive relationship between housing prices and migration, this study reexamines their relationship by using the panel cointegration method and city-level panel data for Taiwan during the 1994–2016 period. The empirical results reveal that migration and housing prices are cointegrated, and the influence of housing prices on migration is significantly positive in the long run. However, the influence of housing price changes on migration is not as significant as expected in the short run. To further examine their short-run relationships, we use quantile regression and the results show that the influence of housing price changes on migration is significantly negative below the 0.5 quantile, but it turns out to be significantly positive in the 0.9 quantile. The influence of housing price changes on migration is not significant between the 0.5 and 0.8 quantiles. We conclude that the influence of housing price changes on migration might be asymmetric in the short run.},

Results of the radon survey were used for analysis of the relationship between the indoor radon and main geologic factors (Pre-Jurassic formations, Quaternary sediments and faults), local geogenic radon potential and anthropogenic factors. Main influencing factors explain 58{\%} of the standard deviation of indoor radon concentration. Association of the air exchange influence over radon concentration with underlying geological media was related to different contributions of geogenic advective and diffusive radon entries. The properties of geological formation to transfer radon gas in interaction with the house can be considered within the radon geogenic potential concept. The study of the radon exposure of the Techa River population can be used to estimate the contribution of natural radon to the overall radiation exposure of the local population during the period of radioactive waste discharges.},

The main focus in this paper is to examine the effect of geographical distance to city centre on the selling price of residential housings in Shanghai. We also discuss how the price gradient varies at different directions in Shanghai. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of applying quality control on the development of a housing price index. The statistical methodology and empirical results obtained in this paper carry interesting implications for other cities in China as well.},

abstract = {Prolonged disruption to aviation during the April-May 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj??kull, Iceland resulted in pressure to predict volcanic ash plume concentrations for the purpose of allowing aircraft to fly in regions with low ash contamination. Over the past few decades there have been a number of incidents where aircraft have encountered volcanic ash resulting in damage to the aircraft and loss of power to engines. Understanding the volcanic ash concentrations that these aircraft have encountered provides important input to determining a safe concentration limit.Aircraft encounters with six volcanic eruption plumes have been studied and ash concentrations predicted using the atmospheric dispersion model NAME. The eruptions considered are Galunggung 1982, Soputan 1985, Redoubt 1989, Pinatubo 1991, Hekla 2000 and Manam 2006. Uncertainties in the eruption source details (start time, stop time and eruption height) and in the aircraft encounter location and flight path are found to be major limitations in some cases. Errors in the driving meteorological data (which is often coarse in resolution for historic studies) and the lack of eruption plume dynamics (e.g. umbrella cloud representation) results in further uncertainties in the predicted ash concentrations.In most of the case studies, the dispersion modelling shows the presence of ash at the aircraft encounter location. Maximum ash concentrations in the vicinity of the aircraft are predicted to be at least 4000??gm -3 although confidence in the estimated concentrations is low and uncertainties of orders of magnitude are shown to be possible. ?? 2011.},

Simultaneously, we also measured the carbon dioxide fluxes in order to deduce the gross primary production. The measurements were conducted from July to September 2009.During the day, the seasonal evolution of the isoprene/monoterpene emissions was studied using a monthly temperature and light dependence function deduced from our results to standardize the fluxes. A seasonal decrease in the standard emission factors was observed, probably linked to acclimation or senescence. The standard emission factor for isoprene fluxes (30 ??C, 1000 ??mol m-2 s-1) fell from 0.91 ?? 0.01 to 0.56 ?? 0.02 ??g m-2 s-1 and for monoterpene fluxes from 0.74 ?? 0.03 to 0.27 ?? 0.03 ??g m-2 s-1.During the night, a slight positive flux of monoterpenes was observed that seemed to be driven by air temperature. The standard emission factor (30??C) for nighttime monoterpene fluxes was equal to 0.093 ?? 0.019 ??g m-2 s-1.Finally, we studied the seasonal evolution of the relationship between the gross primary production and the isoprene/monoterpenes fluxes.

abstract = {Exposure to arsenic causes many diseases. Most Americans in rural areas use groundwater for drinking, which may contain arsenic above the currently allowable level, 10. $\mu$g/L. It is cost-effective to estimate groundwater arsenic levels based on data from wells with known arsenic concentrations. We compared the accuracy of several commonly used interpolation methods in estimating arsenic concentrations in {\textgreater}8000 wells in Texas by the leave-one-out-cross-validation technique. Correlation coefficient between measured and estimated arsenic levels was greater with inverse distance weighted (IDW) than kriging Gaussian, kriging spherical or cokriging interpolations when analyzing data from wells in the entire Texas (p{\textless}0.0001). Correlation coefficient was significantly lower with cokriging than any other methods (p{\textless}0.006) for wells in Texas, east Texas or the Edwards aquifer. Correlation coefficient was significantly greater for wells in southwestern Texas Panhandle than in east Texas, and was higher for wells in Ogallala aquifer than in Edwards aquifer (p{\textless}0.0001) regardless of interpolation methods. In regression analysis, the best models are when well depth and/or elevation were entered into the model as covariates regardless of area/aquifer or interpolation methods, and models with IDW are better than kriging in any area/aquifer. In conclusion, the accuracy in estimating groundwater arsenic level depends on both interpolation methods and wells' geographic distributions and characteristics in Texas. Taking well depth and elevation into regression analysis as covariates significantly increases the accuracy in estimating groundwater arsenic level in Texas with IDW in particular. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Background: When the dependent variable consists of several categories that are not ordinal (i.e., they have no natural ordering), the ordinary least square estimator cannot be used. Instead, a maximum likelihood estimator like multinomial logit or probit should be used. Objectives: The purpose of this article is to understand the multinomial logit model (MLM) that uses maximum likelihood estimator and its application in nursing research. Method: The research on "Racial differences in use of long-term care received by the elderly" (Kwak, 2001) is used to illustrate the multinomial logit model approach. This method assumes that the data satisfy a critical assumption called the "independence of irrelevant alternatives." A diagnostic developed by Hausman is used to test the independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption. Models in which the dependent variable consists of several unordered categories can be estimated with the multinomial logit model, and these models can be easily interpreted. Conclusions: This method can handle situations with several categories. There is no need to limit the analysis to pairs of categories, or to collapse the categories into two mutually exclusive groups so that the (more familiar) logit model can be used. Indeed, any strategy that eliminates observations or combines categories only leads to less efficient estimates.},

abstract = {Economic theory predicts that individual migration decisions for working-age adults will depend on area differences in wages, housing costs, and amenities. While the importance of wages and amenities is well-established from previous empirical studies, evidence regarding housing costs is far less conclusive. We develop and test a new method for representing housing prices in migration analyses. We first provide conditions under which utility-maximizing housing costs can be specified as a function of individual characteristics, similar to a Mincerian wage equation. Using large samples of individuals from the 2000 PUMS, we estimate the relationship between housing costs and individual attributes for each of 291 metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our approach accounts for rental and ownership decisions, the costs of rental and owned properties, and the costs of holding housing capital. We test our housing cost measure using observations of point-to-point migration decisions for a large sample of college-educated males. Our migration model includes additional controls for the wage each individual expects to earn in each area as well as a large set of area amenities. Our key finding is that our proposed housing cost measure yields the expected results (higher housing prices reduce the probability that an area is selected). We re-estimate the model using three alternative metropolitan area measures of housing costs: median house price, average apartment rent, and average urban land rent. These measures consistently produce counterintuitive positive effects of housing costs on area choice.},

abstract = {Geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is the underground disposal ofCO2 from large industrial sources such as power plants. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), also known as Carbon Capture and Sequestration, includes geologic storage as one of its components. CCS is a powerful tool—along with energy efficiency, fuel switching and renewable energy sources—essential to reducing atmospheric CO2 levels. Many studies show that the most effective and least-costly way to reduce CO2 levels to avoid climate change is to use all CO2 reduction tools, including CCS. CO2 is a natural substance in the air that is essential to life. As part of the natural carbon cycle, people and animals inhale oxygen from the air and exhaleCO2. Meanwhile, green plants absorbCO2 for photosynthesis and emit oxygen back into the atmosphere. CO2 is also widely used for many purposes such as carbonating drinks and filling fire extinguishers. As a greenhouse gas, its presence in the atmosphere traps heat from the sun. Normally, this keeps the climate warm enough for life to continue. However, the burning of fossil fuels is increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere above naturally-occurring levels, contributing to global climate change.},

We have investigated the dependence of the rate of dissolution as a function of critical geochemical parameters: pH, pCO2, and carbonate concentration. By using a stirred batch reactor, the kinetics of dissolution of an UO2+x surface layer and the subsequent precipitation of UO2 have also been studied. Although the initial UO2 is pretreated before starting the experiments, it seems to be very difficult to avoid the formation of the oxidized surface layer. For this reason we have developed a thin layer continuous flow-through reactor in order to study the kinetics of dissolution of pure UO2(s). The dependence of the rate of dissolution of these solids on the proton concentration of the solution may be expressed according to the following equations: rdiss(UO2)(mol sec−1m−2) = 1.4(±0.3) × 10−8[H+]0.53 ± 0.08 (3 ⩽ pH ⩽ 7)rdiss(UO2)(mol sec−1m−2) = 1.9(±0.8) × 10−12 (7⩽ pH⩽ 11)rdiss(UO2+x)(mol sec−1m−2) = 1.1(±0.3) × 10−12 [H+]−0.30 ± 0.02 (3 ⩽ pH ⩽ 9) mechanism of dissolution of these solids is surface controlled. rate of dissolution of UO2 in acidic solutions may be described in terms of an integer dependence on the activity of the protonated surface complexes: rdiss(UO2)(mol sec−1m−2) = 1.11 × 1013 {\{}{\textgreater}UOH2+{\}}+ (2 ⩽ pH ⩽ 6)},

Local governments in Japan that promote housing transaction also place importance on the convenience of location, and they do not make effective policy which consider importance on other factors such as the environmental aspect of houses and housing area. This study investigated the factors that influence housing transaction prices in local cities in Japan, and the results will be expected to contribute for making local housing policy considering environmental aspects. The study analyzed recent housing transactions of some local cities located about 100 km north of the centre of Tokyo with a population from about two hundred thousand to five hundred thousand, e.g. Utsunomiya City, using open data that contains transaction prices and various attribute of residential. We estimated hedonic prices and reveal characteristics of each region considering individual housing quality, the convenience of location and the environmental factors. In addition, we conducted a questionnaire survey in multiple detached house areas in Utsunomiya City to clarify the factor of housing choice on the consumer side. The result showed that proximity from the station did not always boost house prices. Moreover, there may be an optimal building density for the city. From the results of the questionnaire, environmental factors have affected to a certain extent on consumer's choice of housing. This study suggested that environmental factors may influence housing selection and price formation. However, information on environmental factors in residential areas is not sufficiently prepared and it is difficult for consumers and residents to obtain it. It will be necessary to prepare it and to create a framework for housing evaluation that considers not only convenience and economy but also environmental factors.},

Employing improved numerical and geometrical features in the model facilitate a physically-based pore-scale simulator. This computational tool is employed to perform several numerical experiments (primary and main drainage, main imbibition) to investigate the current capillarity theory. Traditional two-phase flow formulations state that the pressure difference between the two phase is equal to the capillary pressure, which is assumed to be a function of saturation only. Many theoretical and experimental studies have shown that this assumption is invalid and the pressure difference between the two fluids is not only equal to the capillary pressure but is also related to the variation of saturation with time in the domain; this is referred to as the non-equilibrium capillarity effect. To date, non-equilibrium capillarity effect has been investigated mainly under drainage. In this study, we analyze the non-equilibrium capillarity theory under drainage and imbibition as a function of saturation, viscosity ratio, and effective viscosity. Other aspects of the dynamics of two-phase flow such as trapping and saturation profile are also studied. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Since April 2004, preparatory work prior to CO2 injection has been conducted in the CO2SINK Project, the European Union's first research and development activity on the in-situ testing of geological storage of CO2 near the town of Ketzin, Germany. Carbon dioxide will be injected into a saline aquifer of the Triassic Stuttgart Formation in an anticlinal structure of the northeast German Basin. The drilling of one injection and two observation wells will commence at the end of 2006. The predrilling phase focuses on the baseline geological parameters of the anticline. The Stuttgart Formation is lithologically heterogeneous; it consists of sandy channel-(string)-facies rocks, with good reservoir properties alternating with muddy flood-plain-facies rocks of poor reservoir quality. Playa-type rocks form the immediate cap rock above the CO2SINK reservoir. A geostatistical approach has been applied to describe the reservoir architecture between and beyond well control. This model forms the basis for the generation of reservoir-dynamic models of CO2 injection that assist in the planning of injection operations and in the understanding of CO2 plume evolution. A verification of the geometry of the reservoir and the structural situation of its overburden is expected from a three-dimensional baseline seismic survey that was conducted in the autumn of 2005. Laboratory experiments under simulated in-situ conditions were performed to evaluate the geophysical signature of rocks saturated with CO2. The chemical composition of the groundwater and the CO2 flux in the soil were analyzed across the Ketzin anticline, providing the baseline for a monitoring program during and after injection of CO2, targeted at the detection of potential CO2 leakage from the storage reservoir.},

abstract = {The presence of organics in soils is generally associated with high compressibility, significant secondary compression, often unsatisfactory strength characteristics, and low unit weight. As a result of the above, many state DOTs (Departments of Transportation) in the United States have strict limits on the maximum value of the organic content (2-7{\%}) that can be present in soils to be used as sub grades and backfills. The loss on ignition test is the most widely used technique for measuring organic content. However, especially for low organic content soils, this method can lead to significantly overestimate the true organic content. As a result, certain soils may be incorrectly classified and erroneously considered unviable for certain applications; in other cases unnecessary costly treatments may be requested, even if not required. These are the issues motivating the research presented in this report, which addressed the classification of organic soils and the quantification of organic matter in soils. The research reviewed existing classification systems for organic soils, the effects of organic matter on the geotechnical properties of soils, and the methods for determination of organic content. In addition to the review of the existing literature, this research also included experimental work conducted on natural soils with varying organic content, as well as on laboratory prepared (artificial) organic soils. The experiments performed included loss on ignition tests, Atterberg limits, colorimetric tests, dry combustion tests, thermal analyses, and X-ray diffraction analyses. The work led to propose a system for classifying organic soils which is based on the percentage of organic matter present: soils with organic content mineral soils; if the organic content is {\textgreater}3{\%} and mineral soils with organics; when the organic content exceeds 15{\%} but is organic soil is employed. Finally, soils with organic content higher than 30{\%} are termed highly organic soils or peats. Given the potential errors associated with measuring organic content using the LOI method, this research proposes an approach based on the combined use of the LOI test, the liquid limit test conducted both before.},

abstract = {A new cross validation method called moving window cross validation (MWCV) is proposed in this study, as a novel method for selecting the rational number of components for building an efficient calibration model in analytical chemistry. This method works with an innovative pattern to split a validation set by a number of given windows that move synchronously along proper subsets of all the samples. Calculations for the mean value of all mean squares error in cross validations (MSECVs) for all splitting forms are made for different numbers of components, and then the optimal number of components for the model can be selected. Performance of MWCV is compared with that of two cross validation methods, leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and Monte Carlo cross validation (MCCV), for partial least squares (PLS) models developed on one simulated data set and two real near-infrared (NIR) spectral data sets. The results reveal that MWCV can avoid a tendency to over-fit the data. Selection of the optimal number of components can be easily made by MWCV because it yields a global minimum in root MSECV at the optimal number of components. Changes in the window size and window number of MWCV do not greatly influence the selection of the number of components. MWCV is demonstrated to be an effective, simple and accurate cross validation method.},

When the geostrophic wind, the net heat flux, the surface roughness, the mixing height of the atmosphere and the emission rate of the source are specified, the steady-state pollutant concentration is determined as a function of distance downwind and distance from the surface. Conservation of mass equations for an array of boxes (or nodes) are solved simultaneously by an implicit finite difference scheme for different representative atmospheric conditions and the results discussed. ?? 1973.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of bromine oxide (BrO) in volcanic emissions, there has been speculation concerning its role in chemical evolution and notably ozone depletion in volcanic plumes. We report the first measurements using Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) of BrO in the tropospheric plume of the persistently degassing Erebus volcano (Antarctica). These are the first observations pertaining to emissions from an alkaline phonolitic magma. The observed BrO/SO2 ratio of 2.5 × 10-4 is similar to that measured at andesitic arc volcanoes. The high abundance of BrO is consistent with high abundances of F and Cl relative to sulfur in the Erebus plume.Our estimations of HBr flux and BrO production rate suggest that reactive bromine chemistry can explain a 35{\%} loss of tropospheric O3 observed in the Erebus plume at approximately 30 km from source (Oppenheimer et al., 2010).Erebus also has a permanent lava lake, which could result in generation of NOx by thermal fixation of atmospheric N2 at the hot lava surface. Any NOx emission could play a potent role in reactive bromine chemistry. However, the presence of NO2 could not be detected in the plume, about 400 m above the lake, in our DOAS observations of 2005. Nor could we reproduce spectroscopic retrievals that reportedly identified NO2 in DOAS observations from 2003 made of the Erebus plume (Oppenheimer et al., 2005). Based on the NO2 detection limit of our analysis, we can state an upper limit of the NO2/SO2 ratio of ≤0.012, an order of magnitude lower than previously reported. Our new result supports a rapid oxidation of NOx in the young plume and is more consistent with measurements of NOy species measured using an instrumented aircraft flying in the plume. Model simulations, tuned for Erebus, were performed to reproduce the BrO/SO2 observed in the young plume and to investigate the impact of NOx emissions at source on the subsequent formation of BrO in the plume. They support our hypothesis of rapid conversion of NOx to NOy in the vicinity of the lava lake. This study thus places new constraints on the interaction between reactive nitrogen and bromine species in volcanic plumes, and its effects on ozone. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Current simulation systems face simplifications of personal behaviour, zonal patterns, non-optimisation of public transport trips (choice of the fastest option only), and do not work with real targets and their characteristics. The new TRAMsim system uses a Monte Carlo approach, which evaluates all possible public transport and walking origin-destination (O-D) trips for k-nearest stops within a given time interval, and selects appropriate variants according to the expected scenarios and parameters derived from local surveys. For the city of Ostrava, Czechia, two commuting models were compared based on simulated movements to reach (a) randomly selected large employers and (b) proportionally selected employers using an appropriate distance-decay impedance function derived from various combinations of conditions. The validation of these models confirms the relevance of the proportional gravity-based model. Multidimensional evaluation of the potential accessibility of employers elucidates issues in several localities, including a high number of transfers, high total commuting time, low variety of accessible employers and high pedestrian mode usage. The transport accessibility evaluation based on synthetic trips offers an improved understanding of local situations and helps to assess the impact of planned changes.},

abstract = {Monitoring is essential to assess whether sequestered carbon dioxide (CO2) behaves as expected and whether unexpected migration or leakage occurs. A variety of monitoring techniques have been proposed and examined. Although those techniques provide useful information, such as CO2 migration and distribution, individual information yields only limited insight into CO2 behavior in geological reservoirs. To deepen our understanding of migration and containment of sequestered CO2, a monitoring framework must be established to comprehend the individual sources of information. This paper describes the monitoring framework that was applied to a test field of CO2 sequestration conducted at an onshore site in Nagaoka, Japan. The target aquifer was the early Pleistocene sandstone bed, around 60m thick and 1,100 m below the ground surface. During the 550-day injection period, around 10,000 tonnes of CO2 were sequestered. Three monitoring wells were completed around an injection well and several monitoring schemes, including pressure and temperature measurements, well logging, crosswell tomography, in-situ fluid sampling, were applied. Based on the monitoring results, meso-scale as well as macro-scale migration is examined and discussed. This study addresses monitoring issues in an integrated framework, with emphasis on the importance of comprehensive analyses, since they can bridge the gap between the individual monitoring results. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Soil erosion is the most widespread form of soil degradation. Land area globally affected by erosion is 1094 million ha (Mha) by water erosion, of which 751 Mha is severely affected, and 549 Mha by wind erosion, of which 296 Mha is severely affected. Whereas the effects of erosion on productivity and non-point source pollution are widely recognized, those on the C dynamics and attendant emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are not. Despite its global significance, erosion-induced carbon (C) emission into the atmosphere remains misunderstood and an unquantified component of the global carbon budget. Soil erosion is a four-stage process involving detachment, breakdown, transport/redistribution and deposition of sediments. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is influenced during all four stages. Being a selective process, erosion preferentially removes the light organic fraction of a low density of {\textless} 1.8 Mg/m3. A combination of mineralization and C export by erosion causes a severe depletion of the SOC pool on eroded compared with uneroded or slightly eroded soils. In addition, the SOC redistributed over the landscape or deposited in depressional sites may be prone to mineralization because of breakdown of aggregates leading to exposure of hitherto encapsulated C to microbial processes among other reasons. Depending on the delivery ratio or the fraction of the sediment delivered to the river system, gross erosion by water may be 75 billion Mg, of which 15-20 billion Mg are transported by the rivers into the aquatic ecosystems and eventually into the ocean. The amount of total C displaced by erosion on the earth, assuming a delivery ratio of 10{\%} and SOC content of 2-3{\%}, may be 4.0-6.0 Pg/year. With 20{\%} emission due to mineralization of the displaced C, erosion-induced emission may be 0.8-1.2 Pg C/year on the earth. Thus, soil erosion has a strong impact on the global C cycle and this component must be considered while assessing the global C budget. Adoption of conservation-effective measures may reduce the risks of C emission and sequester C in soil and biota. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In 1994, a total of 3.6 million x-ray examinations were performed; the annual effective dose per capita to the population was 0.05 mSv, and the collective effective dose was 1,000 person-Sv. Chest examinations contributed 63{\%} of the total. Almost all examinations experienced increasing frequency from 1990 to 1994 except for barium studies, cholecystography, and intravenous urography (-23{\%}, -36{\%}, -51{\%}). These decreases are related to the increasing use of ultrasound and greater availability of fiberoptic endoscopy. Notable increases during the same period were observed in computed tomography (161{\%}), cardiac procedures (190{\%}), and mammography (240{\%}). In order to progress from Level II to Level I status Malaysia needs to expand and upgrade radiological service in tandem with the health care development of the country.},

abstract = {Catastrophic failure of large land masses, which generate landslides, rockfalls and debris avalanches, can have hazardous consequences extending far beyond the source. Observations show that the mobility of such events depends strongly on the volume for volumes larger than 106m3, with many different processes invoked to explain higher mobilities (hypermobility) for both terrestrial and extraterrestrial events. Although the mobility of large events has been extensively studied, there is no generally accepted mechanism for predicting extreme travel distances because the underlying physical processes are poorly understood. Here we show using physical and rheological arguments that the wide scatter observed for very large mass wasting events in all environments collapses to a single relationship between event volume or inundation area and mobility. Hypermobility is defined to be the reciprocal of the effective friction coefficient ??e, where the scale-dependent ??e is derived analytically as a function of the mechanical, volumetric and topographical parameters of the flow. The dominant term in the coefficient is the degree of fluidization involved in the flow; our results show that fluidization is limited in extraterrestrial events, that significant fluidization occurs in non-volcanic and volcanic events, and fluidization dominates submarine events. This analysis demonstrates that fluidization is associated with long run-out distances, and that the degree of fluidization can be predicted by the volume, and physical and topographic parameters. The methodology is simple, physically-based and validated with datasets of very large terrestrial and extraterrestrial avalanche events. We demonstrate that the effective Coulomb friction rheology and the hypermobility function are applicable to avalanche events of any size, providing an opportunity to simulate past and/or potential huge landslide and debris avalanche events, run-out distances, destructive impact and assessment of risk. The model can be used to estimate the overrun area and volume in terms of known mobility data. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Cancer constitutes an enormous burden on society in more and less economically developed countries alike. The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Over the years, the burden has shifted to less developed countries, which currently account for about 57{\%} of cases and 65{\%} of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in both more and less developed countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more devel- oped countries; breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among females in less developed countries. Other leading causes of cancer death in more developed countries include colorectal cancer among males and females and prostate cancer among males. In less developed countries, liver and stomach cancer among males and cervical cancer among females are also leading causes of cancer death. Although incidence rates for all cancers combined are nearly twice as high in more developed than in less developed countries in both males and females, mortality rates are only 8{\%} to 15{\%} higher in more devel- oped countries. This disparity reflects regional differences in the mix of cancers, which is affected by risk factors and detection practices, and/or the availability of treatment. Risk factors associated with the leading causes of cancer death include tobacco use (lung, colorectal, stomach, and liver cancer), overweight/obesity and physical inactivity (breast and colorectal cancer), and infection (liver, stomach, and cervical cancer). A substantial portion of cancer cases and deaths could be prevented by broadly applying effective prevention measures, such as tobacco control, vaccination, and the use of early detection tests.},

abstract = {A model is developed for calculation of the radon concentration in indoor air. The model takes into account various important parameters, e.g. radon concentration in ground, radon diffusion resistance of radon barrier, air permeance of ground, air pressure difference between outdoor ground and indoor at ground level, ventilation of the building ground and number of air changes per hour due to ventilation. Characteristic case studies are depicted in selected 2D and 3D graphical plots for easy visualization and interpretation. The radon transport into buildings might be dominated by diffusion, pressure driven flow or a mixture of both depending on the actual values of the various parameters. The results of our work indicate that with realistic or typical values of the parameters, most of the transport of radon from the building ground to the indoor air is due to air leakage driven by pressure differences through the construction. By incorporation of various and realistic values in the radon model, valuable information about the miscellaneous parameters influencing the indoor radon level is gained. Hence, the presented radon model may be utilized as a simple yet versatile and powerful tool for examining which preventive or remedial measures should be carried out to achieve an indoor radon level below the reference level as set by the authorities.},

abstract = {Organic matter is an important factor that cannot be neglected when considering global carbon cycle. New data including organic matter geochemistry at the small watershed scale are needed to elaborate more constrained carbon cycle and climatic models. The objectives are to estimate the DOC and DIC yields exported from small tropical watersheds and to give strong constraints on the carbon hydrodynamic of these systems. To answer these questions, we have studied the geochemistry of eleven small watersheds around Basse-Terre volcanic Island in the French West Indies during different hydrological regimes from 2006 to 2008 (i.e. low water level versus floods). We propose a complete set of carbon measurements, including DOC and DIC concentrations, ??13C data, and less commonly, some spectroscopic indicators of the nature of organic matter. The DOC/DIC ratio varies between 0.07 and 0.30 in low water level and between 0.25 and 1.97 during floods, indicating that organic matter is mainly exported during flood events. On the light of the isotopic composition of DOC, ranging from -32.8 to -26.2??? during low water level and from -30.1 to -27.2??? during floods, we demonstrate that export of organic carbon is mainly controlled by perennial saprolite groundwaters, except for flood events during which rivers are also strongly influenced by soil erosion. The mean annual yields ranged from 2.5 to 5.7tkm-2year-1 for the DOC and from 4.8 to 19.6tkm-2year-1 for the DIC and exhibit a non-linear relationship with slopes of watersheds. The flash floods explain around 60{\%} of the annual DOC flux and between 25 and 45{\%} of the DIC flux, highlighting the important role of these extreme meteorological events on global carbon export in small tropical volcanic islands. From a carbon mass balance point of view the exports of dissolved carbon from small volcanic islands are important and should be included in global organic carbon budgets. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Population density is heterogeneous, and using large spatial areas as a basis for estimates from highly urbanised areas leads to unrepresentative values. This work shows that population density estimated at the census district level (average 225 dwellings) in Canberra, Australia, poorly reflects dwelling types. Data at the individual block level (net or gross block area) greatly improve the estimates. Eight typical dwelling types in Canberra are used to show that there is a relationship between building form and estimated population density only when population density is calculated using the ‘net block' area. To estimate population density at a finer scale than census district, the number of occupants in individual dwellings must be estimated. Assuming a city-wide constant occupancy rate in all dwelling types results in a twofold overestimation of population density in high-density dwellings. Fitting a polynomial function to the occupancy-rate and block-area data for different dwelling types of the city also provides a closer estimate than a categorical (step-wise) estimate; the occupancy rate estimate is then easily calculated from a single variable, the mean gross block size in the census district where the dwelling is located. In high-density dwellings in Canberra (e.g. more than 10 storeys), the occupancy rate was approximately 1.3 people per dwelling and in low-density dwellings (e.g. {\textgreater} 1000 m 2 per dwelling) the occupancy rate approached 2.8 people. This work is of value to researchers and planners who use measures of population density for assessing, for example, the per capita resource sustainability of different buildings.},

abstract = {The spatial interpolation for soil texture does not necessarily satisfy the constant sum and nonnegativity constraints. Meanwhile, although numeric and categorical variables have been used as auxiliary variables to improve prediction accuracy of soil attributes such as soil organic matter, they (especially the categorical variables) are rarely used in spatial prediction of soil texture. The objective of our study was to comparing the performance of the methods for spatial prediction of soil texture with consideration of the characteristics of compositional data and auxiliary variables. These methods include the ordinary kriging with the symmetry logratio transform, regression kriging with the symmetry logratio transform, and compositional kriging (CK) approaches. The root mean squared error (RMSE), the relative improvement value of RMSE and Aitchison's distance (DA) were all utilized to assess the accuracy of prediction and the mean squared deviation ratio was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the theoretical estimate of error. The results showed that the prediction methods utilized in this paper could enable interpolation results of soil texture to satisfy the constant sum and nonnegativity constraints. Prediction accuracy and model fitting effect of the CK approach were better, suggesting that the CK method was more appropriate for predicting soil texture. The CK method is directly interpolated on soil texture, which ensures that it is optimal unbiased estimator. If the environment variables are appropriately selected as auxiliary variables, spatial variability of soil texture can be predicted reasonably and accordingly the predicted results will be satisfied. {\textcopyright} 2013 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.},

The assimilated data base combines satellite-based ozone measurements from 4 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments, 3 dif-ferent retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Exper-iment (GOME), and data from 4 Solar Backscatter Ultra-Violet (SBUV) instruments. Comparisons with the global ground-based Dobson spectrophotometer network are used to remove offsets and drifts between the different data sets to produce a global homogeneous data set that combines the ad-vantages of good spatial coverage of satellite data with good long-term stability of ground-based measurements. One po-tential use of the derived indices is detection of the expected recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole. The suitability of the derived indicators to this task is discussed in the context of their variability and their susceptibility to saturation ef-fects which makes them less responsive to decreasing strato-spheric halogen loading. It is also shown that if the correc-tions required to match recent Earth Probe TOMS measure-ments to Dobson measurements are not applied, some of the indictors are affected so as to obscure detection of the recov-ery of the Antarctic ozone hole.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide soil flux was continuously measured during 4 years (1998-2002) inside the crater of Solfatara by using the 'time 0, depth 0' accumulation chamber method. The CO2 soil flux (??CO2) is strongly influenced by external factors, such as the barometric pressure, the air and soil temperature and humidity, the wind speed, the amount of rain, and so on. Here, we apply a two-step filtering technique to remove the contribution of these external factors from the raw data and to highlight variations in gas flow from depth. In the first step we apply multiple regression and a best-subset search procedure to determine the minimal number of parameters to insert in the regression model. In the second step we apply time filtering on the residuals of the previous analysis through an ARIMA (integrated autoregressive moving average) model which allows us to quantify long-term trends and short-term periodicities. The statistical analysis showed that (1) the highest frequency fluctuations are due to variations of environmental parameters (particularly soil humidity and air temperature) and (2) the long-term trend of the filtered data is correlated with the ground deformation. This correlation is enhanced by back-shifting the CO2 flux signal by 3 months. These observations, along with the likelihood that the ground deformation at Phlegraean Fields is controlled by fluid pressure within the hydrothermal system, indicate that the long-term trend in soil CO2 flux is related to fluid pressure changes at depth. The delay between the soil CO2 flux and the ground deformation is most probably due to the inertia of the gas moving in the subsoil. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Geochemical surveys often contain several tens of components, obtained from different horizons and with different analytical techniques. These are used either to obtain elemental concentration maps or to explore links between the variables. The first task involves interpolation, the second task principal component analysis (PCA) or a related technique. Interpolation of all geochemical variables (in wt{\%} or ppm) should guarantee consistent results: At any location, all variables must be positive and sum up to 100 {\%}. This is not ensured by any conventional geostatistical technique. Moreover, the maps should ideally preserve any link present in the data. PCA also presents some problems, derived from the spatial dependence between the observations, and the compositional nature of the data. Log-ratio geostatistical techniques offer a consistent solution to all these problems. Variation-variograms are introduced to capture the spatial dependence structure: These are direct variograms of all possible log ratios of two components. They can be modeled with a function analogous to the linear model of coregionalization (LMC), where for each spatial structure there is an associated variation matrix describing the links between the components. Eigenvalue decompositions of these matrices provide a PCA of that particular spatial scale. The whole data set can then be interpolated by cokriging. Factorial cokriging can also be used to map a certain spatial structure, eventually projected onto those principal components (PCs) of that structure with relevant contribution to the spatial variability. If only one PC is used for a certain structure, the maps obtained represent the spatial variability of a geochemical link between the variables. These procedures and their advantages are illustrated with the horizon C Kola data set, with 25 components and 605 samples covering most of the Kola peninsula (Finland, Norway, Russia).},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

Moderate to high radon potential is sometimes associated with glacio-fluvial sand and gravel deposits where these overlie a range of bedrocks, some of which have relatively low radon potential. In this latter case the enhanced radon potential is probably caused by the high permeability of superficial deposits. Radon potential tends to be lower when bedrocks characterised by moderate or high radon potential are overlain by relatively impermeable silt-clay alluvium, glaciolacustrine, and lacustrine deposits; peat; and glacial till and moraine. Redistribution of rock debris derived from uranium-rich bedrocks, such as the Mourne Mountains granites, through glacial, alluvial and other processes can also result in higher radon potential being associated with superficial deposits relative to underlying bedrocks.},

Considerable effort was put into distributing available meteorological station data to the model grids as forcing data. The recent EU regional climate modeling initiative ENSEMBLES provided up-to-date climate predictions for two 30-a periods in mid and late 21st century. These were used to estimate evolutions in the water supply of the hydropower reservoir in response to expected climate changes. The simulations suggest a shift of spring peak-flow by almost two months for the end of the century. Warmer winter temperatures will cause higher winter base-flow.

abstract = {Water circulation in the peat bog of a maar depression in the Massif Central (France) was traced with lithium isotopes on water samples collected in the area from springs, surface- and groundwaters, as well as on solid samples taken from peat bogs. Lithium contents fluctuate significantly in the groundwaters, ranging from 0.01??molL-1 in springs feeding the peat bog, up to 28??molL-1 in the groundwater collected in the peat bog. Lithium-isotope compositions (??7Li, {\%}) are extremely variable within the site, ranging from +12{\%} in the stream draining the area up to a 7Li-rich value of +1226{\%} in groundwater from the peat bog. The ??7Li values in the streams agree with those reported in the literature for surface waters, while those of groundwater are far beyond the range of values measured in nature. In the present study, we explain the extremely enriched 7Li signature of the groundwaters by an external input due to Ca-amendment, used in local agriculture. The relationships between Li content and Ca, Mg and HCO3 as well as the lack of a relationship between Li and Na plead in favour of 7Li-enriched carbonate amendments. This hypothesis was tested by Li-isotope analyses on the peat and on several amendment samples (carbonates and NPK fertilizers), confirming the potential role of amendments in the control of Li isotopes in peat land groundwater and showing high ??7Li values in fertilizers. Application of ??7Li ratios to peat land waters provides a unique perspective on the hydrogeochemical dynamics at the scale of this site, as the ??7Li values for the surface water were quasi constant throughout the survey period, and the peat land groundwater does not supply the surface-water runoff and may evolve as a stagnant system. To conclude, the water within the peat land exhibits very high ??7Li values consistent with artificially enriched 7Li associated with Ca amendments. This study opens a new field for Li isotope investigations in hydro-systems and highlights the possibility of using Li isotopes as environmental tracers. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

It was found that 232Th is approximately at saturation and supports the view of Tricca et al. (2001) that Th is precipitated irreversibly upon weathering, leaving surface coatings of 232Th and 230Th on aquifer grains. Uranium in the aquifer waters has very high [234U/238U] ??? 9 and low 238U concentrations. These levels can be explained by low weathering rates in the aquifer (w238U ??? 2 ?? 10-18 to 2 ?? 10-17s-1) using a continuous flow, water-rock interaction model. The Ra isotopes are roughly in secular equilibrium despite their very different mean lifetimes. The 222Rn and 228Ra isotopes in the aquifer correspond to ???10{\%} of the net production rate of the bulk rock. This is interpreted to reflect an earlier formed irreversible surface coating of Th that provides Ra and Rn to the aquifer waters. The surface waters that appear to be feeding the aquifer have low [234U/238U] and high 238U concentrations. The flow model shows that it is not possible to obtain the high [234U/238U] and low [238U] values in the aquifer from a source like the present vadose zone input. It follows that the old aquifer waters studied cannot be fed by the present vadose zone input unless they are greatly diluted with waters with very low U concentrations. If the present sampling of vadose zone sources is representative of the present input, then this requires that there was a major change in water input with much larger rainfall some several thousand years ago. This may represent a climatic change in the Southwest. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {This article challenges Fixed Effects (FE) modeling as the ‘default' for time-series-cross-sectional and panel data. Understanding different within and between effects is crucial when choosing modeling strategies. The downside of Random Effects (RE) modeling—correlated lower-level covariates and higher-level residuals—is omitted-variable bias, solvable with Mundlak's (1978a) formulation. Consequently, RE can provide everything that FE promises and more, as confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations, which additionally show problems with Pl{\"{u}}mper and Troeger's FE Vector Decomposition method when data are unbalanced. As well as incorporating time-invariant variables, RE models are readily extendable, with random coefficients, cross-level interactions and complex variance functions. We argue not simply for technical solutions to endogeneity, but for the substantive importance of context/heterogeneity, modeled using RE. The implications extend beyond political science to all multilevel datasets. However, omitted variables could still bias estimated higher-level variable effects; as with any model, care is required in interpretation.},

abstract = {FOREWORD Male Mortality and Cancer Risk Cancer represents a significant present and future health challenge. This is particularly true of cancer in men. While many advances have been achieved in treatment modalities and survival outcomes, a gender disparity exists in mortality and survival. It is evident in terms of current trends and future predictions that there is a need for a more gender specific and effective targeting of men in terms of tackling the disproportionate impact of cancer mortality on the male population in the Republic of Ireland. The vision and ambition of the Irish Cancer Society is nothing less than a future without cancer. Our mission is to eliminate cancer. It may be said that this is an unrealistic and unrealisable ambition but we are sure that it empowers us to provide the leadership which will see huge leaps forward and significant breakthroughs in the battle against cancer. Firstly we must understand the battle we face and this report applies a gender lens to identify the male specific challenges existing and ahead. The report provides a most valuable overview of the significant issues influencing male mortality and cancer risk. It helps us make sense of the existing incidence, survival and mortality cancer data. Understanding that projections indicate between 2005 and 2035 the overall number of invasive cancers is to increase by 213{\%} or 7{\%} annually for men compared to 165{\%} or 6{\%} annually for women demonstrates the urgency required in addressing this issue. The recommendations contained within are broadly in line with previous documents such as A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland (2006) and the National Men's Health Policy (2008). It identifies that reducing the risk of cancer must be tackled through programmes which influence the uptake of healthy lifestyle options, to include diet and exercise, on a population wide level. Greater awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer are required to improve mortality rates through earlier intervention. This includes access to and uptake of screening programmes such as BowelScreen. It also recognises the requirement for a male specific research focus on the causative factors associated with cancers in men and an understanding of how and why men do or do not seek help at the most appropriate juncture. Masculine traits of self- reliance, physical toughness and emotional control, are identified as being in conflict with positive health behaviour such as reliance on others and requesting medical aid. Addressing these traits successfully will go some way towards addressing gender gaps in mortality and survival. In order to effect change we need to understand what works in relation to behaviour change and healthy lifestyle options in men with a particular emphasis on understanding what works for men living in lower socioeconomic groups. Reducing the risk of cancer is one of the primary goals of the Irish Cancer Society's strategy 2013-2017. This report gives us a valuable tool to understand mortality and cancer risk as it applies to the Irish male and allows us to consider our response through this gender lens. Finally I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of Nick Clarke and Noel Richardson, Centre for Men's Health, Institute of Technology Carlow and Linda Sharp and Eamonn O'Leary of the National Cancer Registry Ireland.

@article{Hengl2007,
abstract = {This paper discusses the characteristics of regression-kriging (RK), its strengths and limitations, and illustrates these with a simple example and three case studies. RK is a spatial interpolation technique that combines a regression of the dependent variable on auxiliary variables (such as land surface parameters, remote sensing imagery and thematic maps) with simple kriging of the regression residuals. It is mathematically equivalent to the interpolation method variously called "Universal Kriging" (UK) and "Kriging with External Drift" (KED), where auxiliary predictors are used directly to solve the kriging weights. The advantage of RK is the ability to extend the method to a broader range of regression techniques and to allow separate interpretation of the two interpolated components. Data processing and interpretation of results are illustrated with three case studies covering the national territory of Croatia. The case studies use land surface parameters derived from combined Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and contour-based digital elevation models and multitemporal-enhanced vegetation indices derived from the MODIS imagery as auxiliary predictors. These are used to improve mapping of two continuous variables (soil organic matter content and mean annual land surface temperature) and one binary variable (presence of yew). In the case of mapping temperature, a physical model is used to estimate values of temperature at unvisited locations and RK is then used to calibrate the model with ground observations. The discussion addresses pragmatic issues: implementation of RK in existing software packages, comparison of RK with alternative interpolation techniques, and practical limitations to using RK. The most serious constraint to wider use of RK is that the analyst must carry out various steps in different software environments, both statistical and GIS. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Question: Which environmental variables best explain patterns in the vegetation of biancane badlands? What is the role of spatial scales in structuring the vegetation of biancane badlands within the agricultural matrix? Location: Five biancane badlands in Central Italy (Tuscany). Methods: An object-oriented approach on high-resolution multispectral images was used to classify physiognomic vegetation types in five biancane badlands. Within each badland, data on vascular plant species abundance were collected using a stratified random design. Variation partitioning based on partial redundancy analysis was used to evaluate the contribution of three sets of environmental predictors, recorded at the spatial scales of plot, patch and biancane badland in explaining patterns in plant community composition. Results: Environmental variables included in the final model – electrical conductivity and carbon/nitrogen ratio (plot scale), shape index (patch scale) and area (biancane badland scale) – accounted for 15.5{\%} of the total variation in plant community composition. Soil characteristics measured at the plot level explained the majority of variation. In the smallest badlands, Bromus erectus perennial grasslands were absent, while annual grasslands, linked with harsh soil conditions (i.e. high soil salinity), were not affected by either the surface area of biancane badlands or by the soil nitrogen availability. Conclusions: The identification of the major predictors of patterns in remnant vegetation requires conducting investigations at multiple spatial scale. Management strategies should operate at different spatial scale, preventing any further reduction in the size of existing badlands and relying on habitat- instead of area-focused conservation practices.},

abstract = {From the end of 2013 and during the following two years, 20kt of CO2sc are planned to be injected in a saline reservoir (1500m depth) at the Hontom{\'{i}}n site (NE Spain). The target aquifers are Lower Jurassic limestone formations which are sealed by Lower Cretaceous clay units at the Hontom{\'{i}}n site (NE Spain). The injection of CO2 is part of the activities committed in the Technology Development phase of the EC-funded OXYCFB300 project (European Energy Program for Recovery - EEPR, http://www.compostillaproject.eu), which include CO2 injection strategies, risk assessment, and testing and validating monitoring methodologies and techniques.Among the monitoring works, the project is intended to prove that present-day technology is able to monitor the evolution of injected CO2 in the reservoir and to detect potential leakage. One of the techniques is the measurement of CO2 flux at the soil-atmosphere interface, which includes campaigns before, during and after the injection operations.In this work soil CO2 flux measurements in the vicinity of oil borehole, drilled in the eighties and named H-1 to H-4, and injection and monitoring wells were performed using an accumulation chamber equipped with an IR sensor. Seven surveys were carried out from November 2009 to summer 2011. More than 4000 measurements were used to determine the baseline flux of CO2 and its seasonal variations.The measured values were low (from 5 to 13gm-2day-1) and few outliers were identified, mainly located close to the H-2 oil well. Nevertheless, these values cannot be associated to a deep source of CO2, being more likely related to biological processes, i.e. soil respiration. No anomalies were recognized close to the deep fault system (Ubierna Fault) detected by geophysical investigations. There, the CO2 flux is indeed as low as other measurement stations. CO2 fluxes appear to be controlled by the biological activity since the lowest values were recorded during autumn-winter seasons and they tend to increase in warm periods. Two reference CO2 flux values (UCL50 of 5gm-2d-1 for non-ploughed areas in autumn-winter seasons and 3.5 and 12gm-2d-1 for in ploughed and non-ploughed areas, respectively, in spring-summer time, and UCL99 of 26gm-2d-1 for autumn-winter in not-ploughed areas and 34 and 42gm-2d-1 for spring-summer in ploughed and not-ploughed areas, respectively) were calculated. Fluxes higher than these reference values could be indicative of possible leakage during the operational and post-closure stages of the storage project. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The solution space (networks) is assumed with "loop feeder circuits": networks with two electrical paths from the high voltage/medium voltage (hv/mv) substations to the customers. In the optimization process, the investment and loss load costs are considered taking into account the constraints of conductor capacities and voltage drop. The investment costs will take into account that some cables can be lying in the same trench. The process was applied for a Spanish city of 200 000 inhabitants.},

abstract = {Human migration is a type of human mobility, where a trip involves a person moving with the intention of changing their home location. Predicting human migration as accurately as possible is important in city planning applications, international trade, spread of infectious diseases, conservation planning, and public policy development. Traditional human mobility models, such as gravity models or the more recent radiation model, predict human mobility flows based on population and distance features only. These models have been validated on commuting flows, a different type of human mobility, and are mainly used in modeling scenarios where large amounts of prior ground truth mobility data are not available. One downside of these models is that they have a fixed form and are therefore not able to capture more complicated migration dynamics. We propose machine learning models that are able to incorporate any number of exogenous features, to predict origin/destination human migration flows. Our machine learning models outperform traditional human mobility models on a variety of evaluation metrics, both in the task of predicting migrations between US counties as well as international migrations. In general, predictive machine learning models of human migration will provide a flexible base with which to model human migration under different what-if conditions, such as potential sea level rise or population growth scenarios.},

abstract = {CO2flux measurements at the soil-atmosphere interface are commonly carried out as part of site characterization in areas elected for CO2geological storage purposes. This approach represents an important monitoring tool to detect and quantify leakages during operational and post-operational stages related to the injection of anthropogenic CO2.A large variety of techniques to measure diffuse CO2soil flux is available and one of the most widely used is the accumulation chamber method. With this method, the total output is statistically estimated after measuring the CO2flux in selected points of a certain area. Several statistical approaches can be applied and it is important to select the most representative and significant procedure. Consequently, in this paper six different methods were used to calculate the total CO2output, as follows: arithmetic mean, minimum variances unbiased estimator, bootstrap resample, partitioning of data into different populations with graphical and maximum likelihood procedures, and sequential Gaussian simulation.Eight campaigns were carried out in the Hontom{\'{i}}n CO2Storage Technology Development Plant (Burgos, Spain) and in natural analogs of CO2storage (Campo de Calatrava, Spain and Mt. Amiata, Caprese Michelangelo and La Solfatara, Italy). Our results showed that sequential Gaussian simulation is the most precise method for evaluating the total CO2output and the respective confidence interval. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total CO2output with other statistical methodologies allowed to develop an application procedure for choosing the most reliable and realistic approach.},

abstract = {Extensive measurements of 222Rn in the town of Xanthi in N Greece show that the part of the town overlying granite deposits and the outcrop of a uranium ore has exceptionally high indoor radon levels, with monthly means up to 1500 Bq m-3. A large number of houses (40{\%}) in this part of the town exhibit radon levels above 200 Bq m-3 while 11{\%} of the houses had radon levels above 400 Bq m-3. Substantial interannual variability as well as the highest in Europe winter/summer ratios (up to 12) were observed in this part of the town, which consist of traditional stone masonry buildings of the late 19th-early 20th century. Measurements of 238U and 232Th content of building materials from these houses as well as radionuclide measurements in different floors show that the high levels of indoor radon measured in these buildings are not due to high radon emanation rates from the building materials themselves but rather due to high radon flux from the soil because of the underlying geology, high radon penetration rates into the buildings from underground due to the lack of solid concrete foundations in these buildings, or a combination thereof. From the meteorological variables studied, highest correlation with indoor 222Rn was found with temperature (r2 = 0.65). An indoor radon prognostic regression model using temperature, pressure and precipitation as input was developed, that reproduced indoor radon with r2 = 0.69. Hence, meteorology is the main driving factor of indoor radon, with temperature being the most important determinant. Preliminary flux measurements indicate that the soil-atmosphere 222Rn flux should be in the range 150-250 Bq m-2 h-1, which is in the upper 10{\%} of flux values for Europe.},

There is generally good agreement between radon maps modelled from the airborne radiometric and soil geochemical data using multivariate linear regression analysis and conventional radon maps which depend solely on geological and indoor radon data. The radon maps based on the Tellus Project data identify some additional areas where the radon risk appears to be relatively high compared with the conventional radon maps.

abstract = {This report analyses the patterns of internal migration and population change across the communes of Denmark as part of a multi-country study of regional population dynamics in Europe, comparing the 1980s and 1990s. Section 2 of the report reviews the recent history of internal migration and regional/local population change in Denmark. Section 3 documents data sources and structure. Section 4 provides a detailed cartographic analysis of the patterns of in-migration, out-migration and net-migration at commune level for 1985 and 1998 (the years selected for study), while section 5 reviews population change between 1985 and 1998. Overall net migration shifts have decreased between the two years. The spatial pattern combines losses from peripheral regions (western Jutland, Bornholm) and Copehagen suburbs with gains to commuting belts centred on Copenhagen and the other large towns. As many other high income European countries, there is a profound contrast between the migration behaviour of young people and other adults (families, older workers and the retired). Young people move strongly towards the centre of the capital region and other large towns, while the other groups deconcentrate. Section 6 analyses the relationships between net migration/population change and the settlement system, to calibrate more precisely the patterns observed on the maps, while sections 7 and 8 look at the relationships between internal migration and economic/functional classifications of the communes. The former relationships are stronger than the latter, but are not as well clearly structured with respect to the urban hierarchy or population density as in many other countries studied. Denmark has reached a system state beyond simple counterurbanisation to be characterised by periurbanisation in the Copenhagen region, reurbanisation in Copenhagen itself and moderate outflows from rural regions.},

abstract = {The context for the emergence of life on Earth sometime prior to 3.5 billion years ago is almost as big a puzzle as the definition of life itself. Hitherto, the problem has largely been addressed in terms of theoretical and experimental chemistry plus evidence from extremophile habitats like modern hydrothermal vents and meteorite impact structures. Here, we argue that extensive rafts of glassy, porous, and gas-rich pumice could have had a significant role in the origin of life and provided an important habitat for the earliest communities of microorganisms. This is because pumice has four remarkable properties. First, during eruption it develops the highest surface-area-to-volume ratio known for any rock type. Second, it is the only known rock type that floats as rafts at the air-water interface and then becomes beached in the tidal zone for long periods of time. Third, it is exposed to an unusually wide variety of conditions, including dehydration. Finally, from rafting to burial, it has a remarkable ability to adsorb metals, organics, and phosphates as well as to host organic catalysts such as zeolites and titanium oxides. These remarkable properties now deserve to be rigorously explored in the laboratory and the early rock record.},

The origin and transport of CO2 and its effects on water-rock interactions during transfer through the shallow crust and discharge to the atmosphere are described.Diagrams and cross-comparison of isodistribution maps of: (1) heat-flow; (2) $\delta$ 18O of thermal springs; (3) elevation of thermal springs; (4) calculated p CO2 in thermal springs; (5) 3He/4He ratio in gas vents; (6) Sr concentration in thermal springs; (7) Sr concentration in travertines; (8) $\delta$ 13C in CO2 gas emissions; and (9) $\delta$ 13C of fossil and active travertines, show systematic geographic zonation in values of $\delta$ 13C in CO2 gas and travertines, Sr concentration in thermal springs and travertines, pCO2 in thermal springs and the 3He/4He ratio in gas phases sampled at surface in central-southern Italy from the western back-arc volcanic Tyrrhenian sector towards the eastern foredeep Adriatic sector.In their lateral westward flow towards the Tyrrhenian coast, meteoric waters precipitating in the high eastern Apennine range mix with ascending magmatic, metamorphic and geothermal fluids in the highly permeable Mesozoic limestones. This fluid mixing causes transfer of poorly condensable components (among which CO2 and H2S) into the regional aquifer and enhances dissolution of limestone to occur faster than in typical, non-thermal karst systems. The carbon isotopic compositions of travertines precipitated along the peri-Tyrrhenian sector are correlated with the carbon isotopic compositions of parent CO2 (metamorphic or organic), whereas the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of travertines inherit the isotopic signature of the dissolved Mesozoic carbonate rock. Although subduction is presently inactive in the northern-central Apennines, the distribution of fluids is typical of active volcanic arcs. Because travertine precipitation is clearly related to climate conditions and all dated travertines in Italy are younger than 500 ka, the analysis of data, in particular the parallel areal distribution of Sr concentration in present thermal springs and fossil travertines, suggests that the westward regional fluid motion has been ongoing since at least 500 ka. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Rapid industrialization and urbanization in the eastern region and the low-cost advantages of the central region promote housing investment and significantly affect GDP. However, GDP has no influence on HPs in the eastern region due to insufficient land supply, housing speculation and HPs deviating from the economic fundamentals. HPs do not Granger cause GDP in the western region because it is less attractive for housing investment. Also, GDP Granger causes HPs in the central and western regions that the economy can influence HPs.

abstract = {he fraction of radon atoms generated from radium decay that are released from into a rock or soil pore space is defined as the radon emanation coefficient, or emanating power, of the material. The emanation coefficient of rocks and soils typically varies between about 0.05 and 0.70, and an average value for soils is probably between 0.20 and 0.30. Geologic, pedologic, and climatic factors, including radium content, grain size, siting of radon parents within soil grains or on grain coatings, and soil moisture conditions, determine the soil's emanating power and radon transport characteristics. Soils derived from similar parent rocks in different regions appear to have significantly different emanation coefficients due to the effects of climate on these soil characteristics. Data on soil radium content, permeability, and moisture content arc available for many areas of the United Stales. With these and data on emanation coefficients, quantitative predictive models for radon generation in rocks and soils at regional to national scales can feasibly be developed. To predict radon generation from soils at a town, neighboorhood, or building-site scale, however, would require data at a greater level of detail than currently exists.},

Soil gas radon concentration ranges between 7 and 176 kBq/m3 indicating a large degree of variability in the NORM content and behavior of the parent soil material related in particular to the occurrence of two different lithologies. Soil gas radon mapping confirmed the existence of two different areas: one along the shoreline of the Bolsena lake, characterized by low soil radon level, due to a prevailing alluvial lithology; another close to the Bolsena village with high soil radon level due to the presence of the high radioactive volcanic rocks of the Vulsini volcanic district. Radon risk assessment, based on soil gas radon and permeability data, results in a map where the alluvial area is characterized by a probability to be an area with high Radon Index lower than 20 {\%}, while probabilities higher than 30 {\%} and also above 50 {\%} are found close to the Bolsena village.},

abstract = {The popularity of a particular term - the Rotten Banana - has paralleled the one-sided centralisation of public services since the Danish Municipal Reform of 2007. The Rotten Banana denotes peripheral Denmark, which takes a geographically curved form that resembles a banana, and it symbolises the belief that rural areas are backward and (too) costly. This article shows how the negative connotations of rural areas have come to outweigh the positive ones and to legitimise liberal visions of the 'sustainable' welfare state. Whereas previous studies on the perceptions of rural dwellers have focused on the discourses of rurality that produce rural outsiders, this article builds on the work of de Certeau and of Laclau and Mouffe. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, the study shows how, in Denmark, negative connotations and centralisation have together spurred a new and political mobilisation in many parts of the 'banana'. Through skilful 'consumption', rural dwellers have adapted the alienating liberalist 'logic of equivalence' to their own use and produced a 'logic of difference', thus challenging the predominant political discourse of rurality. As a result, the Danish Liberal government was forced to introduce a new and more inclusive rural policy in September of 2010 and grant rural dwellers a political voice in parliament. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The deployment of CCS (carbon capture and storage) at industrial scale implies the development of effective monitoring tools. Noble gases are tracers usually proposed to track CO2. This methodology, combined with the geochemistry of carbon isotopes, has been tested on available analogues. At first, gases from natural analogues were sampled in the Colorado Plateau and in the French carbogaseous provinces, in both well-confined and leaking-sites. Second, we performed a 2-years tracing experience on an underground natural gas storage, sampling gas each month during injection and withdrawal periods. In natural analogues, the geochemical fingerprints are dependent on the containment criterion and on the geological context, giving tools to detect a leakage of deep-CO2 toward surface. This study also provides information on the origin of CO2, as well as residence time of fluids within the crust and clues on the physico-chemical processes occurring during the geological story. The study on the industrial analogue demonstrates the feasibility of using noble gases as tracers of CO2. Withdrawn gases follow geochemical trends coherent with mixing processes between injected gas end-members. Physico-chemical processes revealed by the tracing occur at transient state. These two complementary studies proved the interest of geochemical monitoring to survey the CO2 behaviour, and gave information on its use. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Radon exposures were assigned to each residential address in the Oslo region using a geographic information system (GIS) that included indoor radon measurements. The results will be used in an epidemiologic study regarding leukemia and brain cancer. The model is based on 6{\%} of measured residential buildings. High density of indoor radon measurements allowed us to develop a buffer model where indoor radon measurements found around each dwelling were used to assign a radon value for homes lacking radon measurement. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to study the agreement between radon values from the buffer method, from indoor radon values of measured houses, and from a regression model constructed with radiometric data (eTh, eU) and bedrock geology. We obtained good agreement for both comparisons with ICC values between 0.54 and 0.68. GIS offers a useful variety of tools to study the indoor-radon exposure assessment. By using the buffer method it is more likely that geological conditions are similar within the buffer and this may take more into account the variation of radon over short distances. It is also probable that short-distance-scale correlation patterns express similarities in building styles and living habits. Although the method has certain limitations, we regard it as acceptable for use in epidemiological studies.},

abstract = {A new method to investigate active tectonic structures, using soil gas composition at faults, suggests relevant information about regional stress conditions which can be obtained rapidly and at relatively low cost. In 1995, we carried out geochemical profiles around the epicentre of the M=5.1 1980 earthquake near Arudy in the French Pyrenees, where the presence of minor fractures is evident in the field, and confirmed using satellite SPOT imagery. Fractures are conduits facilitating fluid migrations in the crust, and are also pathways for the release of deep-seated gases to the atmosphere. In order to investigate the implication of these fractures in the present deformation, i.e. if they are connected to the Hercynian substratum at a depth of about 1800 m, soil gases were measured along four traverses crossing the observed structures. Gases determined were 222Rn, CO2 and 4He, each of them for their characteristic source: 222Rn has essentially a shallow origin due to its short half-life, whereas CO2 is the major soil gas component with a mainly surficial biogenic source. However, there could additionally be CO2 from crustal or mantle degassing, which would also be the principal sources of He. Data analysis clearly reveals anomalous values for each gas at specific positions along the traverses. Two sets of fractures corresponding to different observed trends are distinguished: the one characterised by He anomalies accompanied by other gases, and the second with few identified He anomalies. The agreement between the geochemical data and the field observations leads us to propose a deformation model for the area studied, analogous to a pull-apart system located in a right lateral shear zone. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Direct measurement of present day CH4 diffuse degassing from the soil represents an effective tool to better estimate the degassing rate of individual sources and to calibrate global Earth degassing estimates. While many data exist on CH4 emissions from ecosystems, agricultural soils and landfills, few estimates of CH4 emissions from volcanic-geothermal areas have been performed. The authors report results and discuss applications of accumulation-chamber measurements of soil CH4 and CO2 flux from Solfatara of Pozuoli (Naples), Vulcano Island and Poggio dell'Olivo (Viterbo) volcanic-geothermal areas, and the Palma Campania landfill (Naples). Volcanic-geothermal study areas are characterised by vent discharges of fluids with different CH4/CO2 ratios (from 4.7??10-5 to 7.5??10-5, 4.7??10-4 and 2.5??10-3 by weight, for Solfatara of Pozzuoli, Vulcano island, and Poggio dell'Olivo areas, respectively). Soil CH4 fluxes range from 0.003 to 48 g m-2 day-1 in the volcanic-geothermal areas and from 0.0021 to 936 g m-2 day-1 in the landfill, with high spatial variability observed in all areas. Using statistical methods different flux populations were distinguished (i.e. background soil gases and deeply derived gases) and the total gas emissions from study sites calculated. The results of this work show that CH4/CO2 ratios of deep fluids, fumarolic fluids in the case of the volcanic-geothermal environment and biogas in landfills, are roughly maintained in the gas phase diffusely degassed by the soil. Due to high spatial variability, a large number of flux measurements and appropriate statistical methods are needed to estimate total gas discharge from study areas. Furthermore, the simultaneous measurement of diffuse CH4 and CO2 fluxes represents a strong constraint for interpretative models of deep processes associated with soil degassing. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Regression-kriging (RK) is becoming an important tool in geostatistics because of the availability of many covariates at high spatial resolution with the advancement in proximal and remote-sensing with positioning technologies. This paper presents the application of a new local RK algorithm for prediction of soil properties. The algorithm was tested using 985 observations for prediction of soil pH, clay content and carbon content in the lower Hunter Valley of New South Wales in Australia. Environmental covariates for the area were compiled. First, the covariates used in regression analysis for each of the soil properties were obtained through a step-wise regression analysis. Secondly, different spatial prediction methods were examined. Finally, the prediction efficiency of various techniques was tested at validation sites using the standardised squared deviation as a measure of the goodness of theoretical estimates. The results from validation showed that the local RK method does not always present the best predictions, but for specific cases it may be highly accurate. We conclude that local RK performance depends on the actual soil and environmental factor relationships, and in general performs no worse than global RK. Furthermore, the advantage of local RK is that it can provide an approach to understand how much the regression models and variogram models change across a region. We have developed a software programme named RKGuider to carry out the local RK steps automatically. Further investigation and numerous datasets are required to verify the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Previous simulations of the behavior of a CO2 plume from a discrete line source near the ground surface have generally assumed that the water-table, soil layering, and land surface were all horizontal. As might be expected, these conditions produce plumes with a high degree of symmetry. The three dimensional TOUGH2 simulations reported here begin to consider several complications: degree of soil heterogene- ity, presence of a capillary barrier, water table depth, CO2 leakage rate, sloping topography, and regional groundwater flow (sloping water-table). The results show that the ground surface CO2 flux distribution can be significantly different due to variation in the aforementioned factors, e.g. presence of a capil- lary barrier. The plume affected by these factors can assume an irregular shape characterized by multiple pathways to the surface. These pathways make the detection of a CO2 leak by soil gas or surface flux mea- surements conditionally possible at tens of meters away from the initial leak location. Such phenomena should be considered when designing CO2 detection network design.},

abstract = {The Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD) has conducted high-resolution airborne gamma ray spectrometer (AGRS), magnetometer and time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) surveys for uranium exploration, along the northern margins of Cuddapah Basin. The survey area includes well known uranium deposits such as Lambapur-Peddagattu, Chitrial and Koppunuru. The AGRS data collected for uranium exploration is utilised for estimating the average absorbed rates in air due to radio-elemental (potassium in {\%}, uranium and thorium in ppm) distribution over these known deposit areas. Further, portable gamma ray spectrometer (PGRS) was used to acquire data over two nearby locations one from Lambapur deposit, and the other from known anomalous zone and subsequently average gamma dose rates were estimated. Representative in-situ rock samples were also collected from these two areas and subjected to radio-elemental concentration analysis by gamma ray spectrometer (GRS) in the laboratory and then dose rates were estimated. Analyses of these three sets of results complement one another, thereby providing a comprehensive picture of the radiation environment over these deposits. The average absorbed area wise dose rate level is estimated to be 130 ± 47 nGy h−1 in Lambapur-Peddagattu, 186 ± 77 nGy h−1 in Chitrial and 63 ± 22 nGy h−1 in Koppunuru. The obtained average dose levels are found to be higher than the world average value of 54 nGy h−1. The gamma absorbed dose rates in nGy h−1 were converted to annual effective dose rates in mSv y−1 as proposed by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effect of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). The annual average effective dose rates for the entire surveyed area is 0.12 mSv y−1, which is much lower than the recommended limit of 1 mSv y−1 by International Commission on Radiation protection (ICRP). It may be ascertained here that the present study establishes a reference data set (baseline) in these areas to assess any changes in gamma radiation levels due to mining and milling activities in future.},

abstract = {This book presents the statistical analysis of compositional data sets, i.e., data in percentages, proportions, concentrations, etc. The subject is covered from its grounding principles to the practical use in descriptive exploratory analysis, robust linear models and advanced multivariate statistical methods, including zeros and missing values, and paying special attention to data visualization and model display issues. Many illustrated examples and code chunks guide the reader into their modeling and interpretation. And, though the book primarily serves as a reference guide for the R package "compositions," it is also a general introductory text on Compositional Data Analysis. Awareness of their special characteristics spread in the Geosciences in the early sixties, but a strategy for properly dealing with them was not available until the works of Aitchison in the eighties. Since then, research has expanded our understanding of their theoretical principles and the potentials and limitations of their interpretation. This is the first comprehensive textbook addressing these issues, as well as their practical implications with regard to software. The book is intended for scientists interested in statistically analyzing their compositional data. The subject enjoys relatively broad awareness in the geosciences and environmental sciences, but the spectrum of recent applications also covers areas like medicine, official statistics, and economics. Readers should be familiar with basic univariate and multivariate statistics. Knowledge of R is recommended but not required, as the book is self-contained},

@article{Giller1998,
abstract = {An increasing body of evidence suggests that microorganisms are far more sensitive to heavy metal stress than soil animals or plants growing on the same soils. Not surprisingly, most studies of heavy metal toxicity to soil microorganisms have concentrated on effects where loss of microbial function can be observed and yet such studies may mask underlying effects on biodiversity within microbial populations and communities. The types of evidence which are available for determining critical metal concentrations or loadings for microbial processes and populations in agricultural soil are assessed, particularly in relation to the agricultural use of sewage sludge. Much of the confusion in deriving critical toxic concentrations of heavy metals in soils arises from comparison of experimental results based on short-term laboratory ecotoxicological studies with results from monitoring of long-term exposures of microbial populations to heavy metals in field experiments. The laboratory studies in effect measure responses to immediate, acute toxicity (disturbance) whereas the monitoring of field experiments measures responses to long-term chronic toxicity (stress) which accumulates gradually. Laboratory ecotoxicological studies are the most easily conducted and by far the most numerous, but are difficult to extrapolate meaningfully to toxic effects likely to occur in the field. Using evidence primarily derived from long-term field experiments, a hypothesis is formulated to explain how microorganisms may become affected by gradually increasing soil metal concentrations and this is discussed in relation to defining 'safe' or 'critical' soil metal loadings for soil protection.},

abstract = {Aerosol emissions from international shipping are recognized to have a large impact on the Earth's radiation budget, directly by scattering and absorbing solar radiation and indirectly by altering cloud properties. New regulations have recently been approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aiming at progressive reductions of the maximum sulfur content allowed in marine fuels from current 4.5{\%} by mass down to 0.5{\%} in 2020, with more restrictive limits already applied in some coastal regions. In this context, we use a global bottom-up algorithm to calculate geographically resolved emission inventories of gaseous (NO(x), CO, SO(2)) and aerosol (black carbon, organic matter, sulfate) species for different kinds of low-sulfur fuels in shipping. We apply these inventories to study the resulting changes in radiative forcing, attributed to particles from shipping, with the global aerosol-climate model EMAC-MADE. The emission factors for the different fuels are based on measurements at a test bed of a large diesel engine. We consider both fossil fuel (marine gas oil) and biofuels (palm and soy bean oil) as a substitute for heavy fuel oil in the current (2006) fleet and compare their climate impact to that resulting from heavy fuel oil use. Our simulations suggest that ship-induced surface level concentrations of sulfate aerosol are strongly reduced, up to about 40-60{\%} in the high-traffic regions. This clearly has positive consequences for pollution reduction in the vicinity of major harbors. Additionally, such reductions in the aerosol loading lead to a decrease of a factor of 3-4 in the indirect global aerosol effect induced by emissions from international shipping.},

The average radon and thoron concentrations for all workplace categories were 10.5±11.3 and 8.2±1.4Bqm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, respectively. The highest radon concentration was detected in a confined area, 86.6±6.0Bqm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, while the maximum thoron level was found in a storage room, 78.1±14.0Bqm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. At each site, the concentrations of radon and thoron were measured at two heights, 5cm and 120cm above the floor. The effect of the measurement heights on the concentration level was significant in the case of thoron. The monitoring of radon and thoron concentrations showed a lower radon concentration during work hours than at other times of the day. This can be attributed to the ventilation systems, including the air conditioner and natural ventilation, which normally operate during work hours. The diurnal variation was less observed in the case of thoron, as the change in its concentration during and after the working hours was insignificant. The study also investigated the influence of the floor level and flooring type on indoor radon and thoron concentrations. The elevated levels of radon and thoron were largely found in basements and ground floor levels and in rooms with concrete flooring.},

abstract = {Background: When the dependent variable consists of several categories that are not ordinal (i.e., they have no natural ordering), the ordinary least square estimator cannot be used. Instead, a maximum likelihood estimator like multinomial logit or probit should be used. Objectives: The purpose of this article is to understand the multinomial logit model (MLM) that uses maximum likelihood estimator and its application in nursing research. Method: The research on "Racial differences in use of long-term care received by the elderly" (Kwak, 2001) is used to illustrate the multinomial logit model approach. This method assumes that the data satisfy a critical assumption called the "independence of irrelevant alternatives." A diagnostic developed by Hausman is used to test the independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption. Models in which the dependent variable consists of several unordered categories can be estimated with the multinomial logit model, and these models can be easily interpreted. Conclusions: This method can handle situations with several categories. There is no need to limit the analysis to pairs of categories, or to collapse the categories into two mutually exclusive groups so that the (more familiar) logit model can be used. Indeed, any strategy that eliminates observations or combines categories only leads to less efficient estimates.},

The report uses demographic indirect estimation techniques based on population data from the JRC Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) to estimate five-year net migration from 1975 to 2015 at a spatial resolution of about 25 km. Main results of a descriptive analysis of our net migration data are: first, at country level, the aggregation of net migration at 25 km resolution is coherent with UN/DESA Population Prospects estimates for most of the countries worldwide. Second, at international level, urban areas, as resulting from the new and harmonized JRC classification of degrees of urbanization, report a positive net migration, stemming from their attractiveness for immigrants. Third, from an economic perspective, high income countries are those rapidly attracting immigrants, while net migration in low income countries tend to be balanced.},

abstract = {Observing and monitoring the different components of the global water cycle and their dynamics are essential steps to understand the climate of the Earth, forecast the weather, predict natural disasters like floods and droughts, and improve water resources management. Earth observation technology is a unique tool to provide a global understanding of many of the essential variables governing the water cycle and monitor their evolution over time from global to basin scales. In the coming years an increasing number of Earth observation missions will provide an unprecedented capacity to quantify several of these variables on a routine basis. In this context, the European Space Agency (ESA), in collaboration with the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), launched the Water Cycle Multi-Mission Observation Strategy (WACMOS) project in 2009. The project aims at developing and validating a novel set of geo-information products relevant to the water cycle covering the following thematic areas: evapotranspiration, soil moisture, cloud characterization and water vapour. The generation of these products is based on a number of innovative techniques and methods aiming at exploiting the synergies of different types of Earth observation data available today to the science community. This paper provides an overview of the major findings of the project with the ultimate goal of demonstrating the potential of innovative multi-mission based strategies to improve current observations by maximizing the synergistic use of the different types of information provided by the currently available observation systems. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {Sediment grain size is well known for its influence on biogeophysical processes and hence, grain size parameter maps, important elements in an integrated ecological modelling strategy. In this study, a large database was compiled from legacy data on grain size parameters and distributions in North Sea surface sediments. The database was analysed by means of non-linear regression to enable a consistent quantification of various grain size parameters. In a second step, multivariate geostatistics (kriging) were employed to predict the spatial distribution of percentage mud content and median grain size in the North Sea with a resolution of 1 × 1 nautical miles. The results show that incorporation of secondary information in the interpolation led to a physically more realistic representation of large-scale patterns compared to deterministic approaches. An evaluation of map confidence, however, suggests only minor differences in the quality obtained by different kriging techniques. It appears that the data density and distribution are not an issue when it comes to performance. Instead, insufficient metadata constrain the assessment and harmonisation of data sets and introduce uncertainty into the predictions.},

EC CO2 fluxes ranged from 218 to 3500 g m- 2 d- 1 (mean = 1346 g m- 2 d- 1). Using footprint modeling, EC CO2 fluxes were compared to CO2 fluxes measured by the chamber method on a grid repeatedly over a 10-day period. Half-hour EC CO2 fluxes were moderately correlated (R2 = 0.42) with chamber fluxes, whereas average daily EC CO2 fluxes were well correlated (R2 = 0.70) with chamber measurements. Average daily EC CO2 fluxes were correlated with both average daily wind speed and atmospheric pressure; relationships were similar to those observed between chamber CO2 fluxes and the atmospheric parameters over a comparable time period. Energy balance closure was assessed by statistical regression of EC energy fluxes (sensible and latent heat) against available energy (net radiation, less soil heat flux). While incomplete (R2 = 0.77 for 1:1 line), the degree of energy balance closure fell within the range observed in many investigations conducted in contrasting ecosystems and climates. Results indicate that despite complexities presented by the HLTK, EC can be reliably used to monitor background variations in volcanic CO2 fluxes associated with meteorological forcing, and presumably changes related to deeply derived processes such as volcanic activity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Effective dose was introduced by the ICRP for the single, over-arching purpose of setting limits for radiation protection. Effective dose is a derived quantity or mathematical construct and not a physical, measurable quantity. The formula for calculating effective dose to a reference model incorporates terms to account for all radiation types, organ and tissue radiosensitivities, population groups, and multiple biological endpoints. The properties and appropriate applications of effective dose are not well understood by many within and outside the health physics profession; no other quantity in radiation protection has been more confusing or misunderstood. According to ICRP Publication 103, effective dose is to be used for "prospective dose assessment for planning and optimization in radiological protection, and retrospective demonstration of compliance for regulatory purposes." In practice, effective dose has been applied incorrectly to predict cancer risk among exposed persons. The concept of effective dose applies generally to reference models only and not to individual subjects. While conceived to represent a measure of cancer risk or heritable detrimental effects, effective dose is not predictive of future cancer risk. The formula for calculating effective dose incorporates committee-selected weighting factors for radiation quality and organ sensitivity; however, the organ weighting factors are averaged across all ages and both genders and thus do not apply to any specific individual or radiosensitive subpopulations such as children and young women. Further, it is not appropriate to apply effective dose to individual medical patients because patient-specific parameters may vary substantially from the assumptions used in generalized models. Also, effective dose is not applicable to therapeutic uses of radiation, as its mathematical underpinnings pertain only to observed late (stochastic) effects of radiation exposure and do not account for short-term adverse tissue reactions. The weighting factors incorporate substantial uncertainties, and linearity of the dose-response function at low dose is uncertain and highly disputed. Since effective dose is not predictive of future cancer incidence, it follows that effective dose should never be used to estimate future cancer risk from specific sources of radiation exposure. Instead, individual assessments of potential detriment should only be based on organ or tissue radiation absorbed dose, together with best scientific understanding of the corresponding dose-response relationships.},

abstract = {Spatial distribution of concentrations of radon gas in the soil is important for defining high risk areas because geogenic radon is the major potential source of indoor radon concentrations regardless of the construction features of buildings. An area of southern Italy (Catanzaro-Lamezia plain) was surveyed to study the relationship between radon gas concentrations in the soil, geology and structural patterns. Moreover, the uncertainty associated with the mapping of geogenic radon in soil gas was assessed. Multi-Gaussian kriging was used to map the geogenic soil gas radon concentration, while conditional sequential Gaussian simulation was used to yield a series of stochastic images representing equally probable spatial distributions of soil radon across the study area. The stochastic images generated by the sequential Gaussian simulation were used to assess the uncertainty associated with the mapping of geogenic radon in the soil and they were combined to calculate the probability of exceeding a specified critical threshold that might cause concern for human health. The study showed that emanation of radon gas radon was also dependent on geological structure and lithology. The results have provided insight into the influence of basement geochemistry on the spatial distribution of radon levels at the soil/atmosphere interface and suggested that knowledge of the geology of the area may be helpful in understanding the distribution pattern of radon near the earth's surface.},

abstract = {In most European countries ethnic minorities have had a tendency to settle in certain parts of cities-and often in social housing-together with other immigrants in so-called multiethnic neighbourhoods. An explanation for this could be low income combined with lack of knowledge of the housing market and discrimination, which limits the housing possibilities for ethnic minorities. Another explanation could be that for different reasons immigrants choose to settle in so-called ethnic enclaves where they can find an ethnic social network, which can support them in their new country. In traditional research literature about immigration it has been shown that for many immigrants living in enclaves has been a temporary situation. The 'spatial assimilation theory' says that this situation ends when the family has become more integrated in the new society and then moves to another part of the city. This paper provides evidence to support both explanations of why ethnic minorities move to and from multi-ethnic neighbourhoods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a partitioning tracer test using noble gases to measure residual CO2 saturation in the field as one part of the CO2CRC residual saturation and dissolution test sequence. Noble gas tracers were used in a sequential partitioning tracer test. The first tracer test was performed prior to CO2 injection to characterise the aquifer under single-phase conditions. The second tracer test was performed after CO2 had been driven to residual saturation. The noble gas tracers can be regarded as non-partitioning aqueous-phase tracers in the undisturbed aquifer and subsequently as water/CO2 partitioning tracers in the presence of the residual CO2 saturation.One-dimensional radial simulations are used to estimate residual saturation from the tracer tests by fitting only two independent parameters: the apparent dispersivity of each tracer in the aqueous phase and the residual CO2 saturation. This analysis method is validated by successful application to krypton (Kr) and xenon (Xe) production curves from the field data.Both tracers give the same estimate of residual saturation to within the accuracy of the method. Furthermore the estimated residual saturation from the noble gas tracer tests is consistent with independent measurements. However the analysis of the two tracer production curves indicates that Xe has higher dispersivity than Kr, despite having been injected and produced simultaneously and measured from the same samples. Finally the application of this sequential tracer test method to other field settings is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Most migration literature focuses on large scale movements of people across country borders, while the internal migration trends of countries are commonly neglected, despite the fact that the understanding of internal migration trends is crucial for planning the future for a country. In Iraq a major reason for migration has been security - a direct result of its turbulent history since the 1980's. More recently, the Kurdistan Region in Iraq has stabilized which has led to more voluntary population movements, such as economic migration. This paper seeks to investigate the internal and external movements in Duhok Governorate, Kurdistan, Iraq, during the past decade. This is done by looking at reasons for migration, characteristics of the migrants, and the time for migration. Data on migration, environment, and rural livelihoods were collected through 606 interviews in rural villages in Duhok Governorate. Additionally, 600 interviews were conducted in the urban areas of Duhok, Semel, Zakho, and Amedi, in order to capture the rural to urban migration. The study found economic reasons to be the main motivation for migration, closely followed by family/marriage. Contradicting common notions of urbanization, there is a trend of urban to rural migration for households. Individuals, however, are more prone to migrate abroad or from rural to urban areas. Environmental migration is low and can be explained by the low dependence on agriculture in the region. {\textcopyright} Eklund and Pilesj{\"{o}};.},

abstract = {CO2 uptake during plant photosynthesis and CO2 loss during plant and microbial respiration were added to a land surface process model to simulate the diurnal and annual cycles of biosphere-atmosphere CO2 exchange. The model was coupled to a modified version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model version 2, and the coupled model was run for 5 years. The geographic patterns of annual net primary production are qualitatively similar to other models. When compared by vegetation type, annual production and annual microbial respiration are consistent with other models, except for needleleaf evergreen tree vegetation, where production is too high, and semidesert vegetation, where production and microbial respiration are too low. The seasonality of the net CO2 flux agrees with other models in the southern hemisphere and the tropics. The diurnal range is large for photosynthesis and lower for plant and microbial respiration, which agrees with qualitative expectations. The simulation of the central United States is poor due to temperature and precipitation biases in the coupled model. Despite these deficiencies the current approach is a promising means to include terrestrial CO2 fluxes in a climate system model that simulates atmospheric CO2 concentrations, because it alleviates important parameterization discrepancies between standard biogeochemical models and the land surface models typically used in general circulation models, and because the model resolves the diurnal range of CO2 exchange, which can be large (15-45 t • mol CO 2 m -2 s -1). 1. Introduction Numerous models of land-atmosphere exchanges of en-ergy, moisture, and momentum have been developed for use with atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) (e.g., biosphere-atmosphere transfer scheme (BATS) [Dickinson et al., 1993], simple biosphere model (SiB) [Sellers et al., 1986], simple SiB [Xue et al., 1991], bare essentials of surface transfer (BEST) [Pitman et al., 1991], Canadian land surface scheme (CLASS) [Verseghy, 1991; Verseghy et al., 1993], and sch6matisation des 6changes hydriques h l'inter-face entre la biosphi, re et l'atmosph • ,re (SECHIBA) [Du-coudr • et al., 1993]). These land surface process models provide the surface fluxes of solar radiation, infrared radia-tion, wind stresses, latent heat, and sensible heat required by GCMs, typically with a time step of less than 30 min. Although land surface process models were originally conceived to account for differences among vegetation and soil types that affect biophysical land-atmosphere interac-tions, they may also provide a convenient means to add terrestrial CO2 fluxes as part of a climate system model that simulates the diurnal and annual cycles of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The physiological relationships between CO2 assimilation and environmental factors such as air tempera-ture, irradiance, vapor pressure, soil water, and foliage nitrogen are well understood.

There is considerable public concern about radon exhalation from building materials and the contribution to indoor radon levels. To address this concern, radon exhalation rates were determined for 53 different samples of drywall, tile and granite available on the Canadian market for interior home decoration. The radon exhalation rates ranged from non-detectable to 312 Bq m(-2) d(-1). Slate tiles and granite slabs had relatively higher radon exhalation rates than other decorative materials, such as ceramic or porcelain tiles. The average radon exhalation rates were 30 Bq m(-2) d(-1) for slate tiles and 42 Bq m(-2) d(-1) for granite slabs of various types and origins. Analysis showed that even if an entire floor was covered with a material having a radon exhalation rate of 300 Bq m(-2) d(-1), it would contribute only 18 Bq m(-3) to a tightly sealed house with an air exchange rate of 0.3 per hour. Generally speaking, building materials used in home decoration make no significant contribution to indoor radon for a house with adequate air exchange.},

abstract = {Geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been proposed as a viable means for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Once injection begins, a program for measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) of CO2 distribution is required in order to: a) research key features, effects and processes needed for risk assessment; b) manage the injection process; c) delineate and identify leakage risk and surface escape; d) provide early warnings of failure near the reservoir; and f) verify storage for accounting and crediting. The selection of the methodology of monitoring (characterization of site and control and verification in the post-injection phase) is influenced by economic and technological variables. Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) refers to a methodology developed for making decisions in the presence of multiple criteria. MCDM as a discipline has only a relatively short history of 40 years, and it has been closely related to advancements on computer technology. Evaluation methods and multicriteria decisions include the selection of a set of feasible alternatives, the simultaneous optimization of several objective functions, and a decision-making process and evaluation procedures that must be rational and consistent. The application of a mathematical model of decision-making will help to find the best solution, establishing the mechanisms to facilitate the management of information generated by number of disciplines of knowledge. Those problems in which decision alternatives are finite are called Discrete Multicriteria Decision problems. Such problems are most common in reality and this case scenario will be applied in solving the problem of site selection for storing CO2. Discrete MCDM is used to assess and decide on issues that by nature or design support a finite number of alternative solutions. Recently, Multicriteria Decision Analysis has been applied to hierarchy policy incentives for CCS, to assess the role of CCS, and to select potential areas which could be suitable to store. For those reasons, MCDM have been considered in the monitoring phase of CO2 storage, in order to select suitable technologies which could be techno-economical viable. In this paper, we identify techniques of gas measurements in subsurface which are currently applying in the phase of characterization (pre-injection); MCDM will help decision-makers to hierarchy the most suitable technique which fit the purpose to monitor the specific physic-chemical parameter. {\textcopyright} 2014 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

The asymptotic properties of the SEs are developed using the notion of asymptotic distributional risk. We then compare the relative performance of the LASSO estimator with two SEs in terms of simulated relative efficiency. A simulation study shows that the shrinkage and LASSO estimators dominate the full model estimator. Further, both SEs perform better than the LASSO estimators when there are many inactive predictors in the model.

abstract = {Mud volcanoes are cold seeps, in which the escape of gas and fluids associated with mud creates 3-D bottom structures that enhance the spatial heterogeneity and potentially alter the functioning of the benthic ecosystems. We investigated a complex system of mud volcanoes of the Mediterranean Sea characterised by the presence of different structures (i.e., isolated domes, domes surrounded by moats, clustered domes, and ridges) displaying different levels of seepage. We hypothesize that the combined effects of seafloor heterogeneity (i.e., different 3-D structures as revealed by detailed topographic analysis), fluid emissions and trophic characteristics of these systems can influence the structural and functional biodiversity of meiofauna (with special focus on the nematodes). We found that sediments affected by intensive seepage displayed the lowest faunal abundances and number of higher taxa. However, mud volcanoes without emissions, but characterized by a high structural complexity (such as the ridges), were associated with the highest meiofaunal abundances and number of higher taxa. Mud volcanoes hosted also a remarkable abundance of rare taxa specifically associated with these structures (e.g., acarians, cumaceans, tanaids, cladocerans and hydroids) and absent in slope sediments (used as a control). Each mud-volcano area displayed a different nematode species composition. Overall 76 nematode species (from a total of 235) were exclusively associated with mud-volcano structures, whilst 29 were exclusively encountered in slope sediments. We conclude that the presence of mud volcanoes, for their contribution to increase spatial heterogeneity and for the extreme conditions associated with gas emissions, promotes higher levels of beta diversity, thus enhancing the regional (gamma) benthic diversity. These findings provide new insights on the factors controlling meiobenthic biodiversity in mud volcanoes and clues for future action of conservation of the biodiversity specifically associated with these habitats. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We start by suggesting procedures for exploring and re-arranging panel data sets and for preparing them for further analyses. A large part of this chapter demonstrates the application of various “traditional” panel data estimators that are used frequently in scientific and applied analyses. Furthermore, we explain the estimation of several “modern” panel data models, such as panel time series models and dynamic panel data models. Finally, this chapter shows how to use statistical tests to test critical hypotheses under different assumptions and how the results of these tests can be used to select the panel data estimator that is most suitable for a specific empirical panel data analysis.},

abstract = {Changes in housing demand because of population migration may have a great influence on urban housing prices. The objective of this paper is to investigate how the two aspects of population migration, including inter-regional migration and rural-urban migration, affect housing prices at city level in China. By using the data of the population sampling survey in 2005 and the sixth population census in 2010, a series of empirical studies have been conducted. The results of pooled cross-section data show that an increase in inter-regional migrants by 1{\%} will lead to a rise in housing prices by 0.701{\%} when controlling the other relevant factors. Likewise, an increase in the level of urbanization by 1{\%} will drive up housing prices by 0.343{\%}. Furthermore, the study figures out that the better educated migrants are more likely to affect local housing prices, and the cities with more migrants with higher educational level are expected to experience higher housing prices, which sheds some light on the mechanism of the relationship between migration and housing price. The findings are helpful to China's government in population-related policy making and planning.},
